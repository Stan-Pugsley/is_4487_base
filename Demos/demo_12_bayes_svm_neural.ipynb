    "In this example, we use a small set of email text samples. Each email is labeled as either:\n",
    "- `1` for **Spam** (e.g., containing promotional keywords like \"win\", \"free\", \"prize\")\n",
    "- `0` for **Not Spam** (e.g., work-related messages like \"project\", \"meeting\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns the patterns of words that typically appear in spam vs. non-spam emails and makes predictions accordingly.\n"
