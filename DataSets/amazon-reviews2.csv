This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase.
"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!"
"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family
Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.."
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.
"This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet."
Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it!
Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money
"My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera"
I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.
Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem
"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire .
More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet."
"Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.
Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since
My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.
Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it."
I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.
I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners
Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.
Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle."
my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness."
Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
"She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her ""bargain"" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it."
"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.
This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more!
"The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
"totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis!"
Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."
It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!!"
"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
"I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
"Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on."
"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy."
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!
Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.
"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad
Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
"My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good"
So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!"
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product
"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
"I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device."
also great for listening to music and also for movies
The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it
So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
"We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work."
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.
got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
"This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music."
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.
"Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it."
"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons
I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL
Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use.
After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It's the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday!
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed."
"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!"
I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
"I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!
I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet)."
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas.
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
"Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!
Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
"Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.
"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase."
less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down
"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.
"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied."
Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
"Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media."
"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.
I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts
Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with
Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.
"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well."
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal
Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch."
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased.
My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry
"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!!
Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use."
I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs."
"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
"I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet."
Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."
"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage"
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.
"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
"This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!"
"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
"Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product"
"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading"
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.
Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!
This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.
"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.
This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
"Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire."
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!
"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.
"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
"I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well."
This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection."
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.
"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
Thank..............................................
"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward."
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos.
This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
This is I think the best product I've bought. I already own eight that I've purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price.
I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use
Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
"A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT!"
"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc."
My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!
Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.
I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.
Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market."
Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.
Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints
So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.
Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.
"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.
I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.
I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.
This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.
We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.
Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes."
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.
Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy."
"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price
This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé."
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
"Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet"
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
"Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything"
Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet."
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product"
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email."
"Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark"
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.
We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough."
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net
"Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now."
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great,"
"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it."
"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun."
"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
"Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages."
"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it."
"This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)"
Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet."
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
"awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies"
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp.
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better."
"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!
"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
"I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.."
"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.
"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
"I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all.
I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
"I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
i would buy this item again. however charging port is
"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
"I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet"
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop."
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
"I love to read! Books,books, books and more books."
"Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product!"
Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version.
I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience."
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!
My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music."
"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
"Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy"
I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
"Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
"Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7"". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast."
"I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it
"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.
"I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!"
I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
Great device very functional love it will recommend
Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it!
Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc."
The tablet works just great and the price can't be beat!
We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits."
"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!
Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
Good product with best price available in the market place
Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.
"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading
Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
"This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter."
"Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one."
Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome!
The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs
The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy!
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.
Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them
"Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get."
"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
"I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use.
This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
"Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
"Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email."
"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining
"Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it!
We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching
asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
"Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent.
"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.."
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.
"use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet"
"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children.
"I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed."
Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing
"This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable."
Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
"It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer."
So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good
Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets
Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money.
Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os
I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips
Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
"I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!
"This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer."
very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months
"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
I'd recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use.
Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon.
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
"I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift."
"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
I bought four of these for my kids and they love them
Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child
Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.
Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books."
"Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable."
I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!"
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.
I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for.
"We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it"
This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
"I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it."
You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.
"love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses."
I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
"I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product."
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.
Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on.
"Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well"
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
"Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media."
"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
"Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
"I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad!"
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
Better then the older models bigger and better then before
I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don't like is that I can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that's to be expected.
I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.
"The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,"
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank."
"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.
"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
"Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks
"Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price"
Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale.
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday
"Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading."
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
"Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings."
"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!"
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
"Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!"
love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read."
Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
"very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos."
I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use.
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies."
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet.
I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price."
"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads."
"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music.
Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own .
Great tablet for children and for entertainment...
This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger"
"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There's ways to switch it to kid friendly
This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
"this is my 2nd hd 8, very fast and easy, great value"
Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it!
Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games."
This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read."
"good value for the money, love the kindle for reading"
"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference."
Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value.
"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
"For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission."
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.
Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.
"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
"It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast."
The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.
Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.
"great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price"
This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!
"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
"Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further."
"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage.
I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
"This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.
did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
I love this tablet! It's the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable!
"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.
Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor"
"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
"The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
Great size and storage for reading my online books
Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
It's such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I'm glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday
Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet
My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.
Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
"Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up."
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.
Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price.
I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy.
I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap."
The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
"It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want."
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
"I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"ilovemy kindle 8"" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8"" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know."
Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they
LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
"My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.
It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present
I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues.
"I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase."
One of the best tablets on the market for its value
Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
Strong fast tablet. My 8 year old can manage it perfectly!
Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.
Does not let me connect with my library. Very diapointed
I purchased this for my wife so that she has an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet.
I Love this tablet its Awesome and way Cool I highly recommend this to anyone Great price
great value for the pricing...black friday special
"Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost"
It is very handy great when i don't want to use a computer and i can take it anywhere
Bought it for my wife and the fire does not have to be recharged as often as the paper white. she likes it
bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
"I started with the 7"" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."
A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else.
Great gift idea. Nice addition to the kindle family.
So far it does what I want. Very happy with the price too.
"I read the reviews, before I purchased this item and.... So far, so GOOD! The handy-dandy case that I found on sale for 9.99, at the same time works well too."
"I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet."
Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
Perfect for my wife and college daughter. Very easyTo learn reader.
"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.
Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.
I thought twice about getting this because of people saying you have limited apps but its not to limited so I am very happy. I was able to get google youtube Netflix and all the main apps I actually care about. For the price you cannot do any better. Love it so much we ended up getting my kids each one.
good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas
Key to owning this tablet is having amazon prime account
Easy to use and navigate. Great for watching movies and videos!!
Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
Best deal I have seen online. I checked Amazon and they were not as good.
We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
I bought 3 three of these for my boys for Christmas gifts. Great little tablet. Perfect for everything they want to use it for.
Greatest small tablet. Just wanted something convenient.
My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away
"The amazon kindle fire is a great reader on a budget. It has most of the basic functions of standard tablets(Ipad, galaxy tablets) at a fraction of the cost. It also has access to a huge amazon library of books."
"We got 2 of these tablets in black Friday for a great price! its a pro if you have amazon prime, since everything around this tablet is amazon base- shopping, videos, books, and alexa."
"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
Always a good price and good for what it's meant for.
"Amazon Fire is great for reading my Kindle Books, checking email, facebook, or checking out the internet. Haven't ck'd out what else I can do with it, but I'm sure there is a lot."
"Love the Amazon Fire HD tablet, easy to get around"
"Download games, movies, education apps to help ur kids to learn to read do math problems and keep them entertained while on the road or family trips"
These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
My daughter had a smaller eight GB tablet ... this was a nice step up for her and with better graphics. We extended the memory with an SD card for photos.
Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
Love this Kindle. It is my fourth kindle and it is best one yet.
This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system
"I have had many tablets, Samsung, Asus and old Ipad. This Fire holds its own . The Silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. There is a hack to get more google apps. It's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. I enjoy taking advantage of the Prime benefits. Simple to operate. Would recommend for everyday use and movie/reading music consumption."
"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
"There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding."
Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.
"This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!."
"I got exactly what I was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption (e-books, movies, music) with surprisingly decent performance in the few games I've tried on the device. The MicroSD expansion card slot is a must-have for me when purchasing any tablet device."
"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
Most people will go with a bigger more sofisticated iPad or Samsung but this is a good product for a child to pass time or someone not wanting all the bells and whistles
Perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around
"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
Purchased the 8 inch Fire tablet during Black Friday and have been using it since. A great deal.
Doesn't disappoint. Nice features. Owned two prior to this one. Very nice tablet.
This is my first tablet and I'm excited about learning how to use it.
I have not used it a ton yet but I am very happy with my experience so far.
This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
I started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price was too good to pass up!
"I LOVE my fire! I subscribe to both Amazon Prime and Netflix, and it's perfect for those. Plus you can add additional memory cards. I have bought iPads for everyone in my house, and bought this for myself and am in heaven. The camera isn't good though, but I don't use it. For the money, this is an incredible value."
Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.
Great value for such a well made tablet. Everything you need for a low price
I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
"Loved the Fire HD7 but the latest HD8 is sharper, faster and still handles great."
Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
"Great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. I installed a 128 GB microSD card with no problems. I was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet I had previously purchased. I wished I had gotten a few more during the black Friday sale. It came with a charger and cable."
Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!
Great all around Tablet. Does a little bit of everything along with being the best e-reader around.
Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.
"Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!"
This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets.
Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!
"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
"My mom had been wanting one for a while, so this was great."
The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
Great budget tablet. Just needs good sized microsd card!
Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure
"I"" like it a lot, easy to use , A big improvement over the original, the price was increideble (black friday special)onclude a camera , front and rear, the quality is not as good as a cell phone, but is ok"
This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
"No complaints. I just wish it played .avi, but that is not really a huge problem"
I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!
"After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use."
"Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7"" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift."
Very user friendly and straight forward instructions great for all ages
I had a smaller version and this was easy to adjust to and use.
Really affordable present for a kid.. Or just have around
It's a great tablet for the price. Fast and snappy
"This is a nice and cheap android device. HD display and Amazon's sturdy build quality with 10 hours+ battery backup. Sometimes runs a little slow, rest is good"
"Upgrade to my kindle fire 7, pleased with all the new features including Alexa"
"I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
"Bought on Black Friday for my kids, my 3 year old can work it just fine with the kids app for watching YouTube and other videos."
I picked this up as a doorbuster for my father-in-law. He has an Amazon account and can watch the movies he likes.
My kids like it very much! The price is low. The tablet is light weighted.
Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift."
This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.
Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!
Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
This was a gift for one of my granddaughters. She just loves this Kindle. This is the second one I've bought for her. This is a bigger and newer generation with lots more options.
Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
"Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth"
"It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.
Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!!
"Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!"
Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids
Our tablet is fast and works very well. I am pleased with the amount of apps that Amazon offers.
"This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already."
"My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable."
Great table I pay cheap price is gift for my son my son is happy
My daughter loves this tablet. Uses it for Netflix!
"So impressed with the battery life on this! My phone's battery is almost dead in the morning, but this thing can play music for 8 hours and the battery just goes down 20%. :)"
I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children
The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad
Tmtis is the second tablet I purchased for my kids. Its perfect for all the things my kids do.
Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
I love how you can keep up with social media and watch movies online. This is fantastic!!!
My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
"needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us"
Works great. Easy conversion for an aging guy without much technological experience.
"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
"I bought this as an upgrade from my old Kindle. Works awesome, i can even watch movies through my Amazon Prime. Plenty of apps to choose from. Awesome little tablet."
Great beginner tablet for all ages. Easy to use by all ages.
Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!
"Newest version of Kindle Fire product line is a hit. Larger screen for not much money, good screen resolution and longer battery life. No problems, and I'm a happy reader!"
"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.
Nice size tablet. Very easy to use. Love it!!!!! Beats my laptop.
"Love the tablet not to small, lightweight, and is easy to use."
"This tablet is the best you can buy for the money. Great apps, great picture."
Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend.
This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
"This is a Great budget table, it has has Great features for the price"
I was looking for at replacement tablet and this is exactly what I needed
The tablet is great the jacket not so much - doesn't stand up - hate it
Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
"Great kindle, perfect size screen, I love using it just as much as my iPad mini and regular size iPad! Easier to travel with!"
This is really nice and has great clarity I like it.
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
I use it everyday after work for down time.........
I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.
"This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged."
For what it does it's great for me a good alternative
I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.
"Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
Got this for my kid. Great cheap tablet. Camera aren't so good but usable. Apps load quick.
Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books.
"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."
Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
"awesome, great value, good quality product, I would recommend this to anyone"
Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.
"I bought this tablet for my 7 years old and love it. Great parental control, set up goals for the day, turns off at the time, I decided. Works perfectly and very fast processor"
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
Perfect for streaming and an E-reader at a great price.
"Love this tablet. It does everything I need it to.My problem is, I have family that falls in love with it so I give mine away. If this wasn't good, I wouldn't be on my 3rd one.The only thing I would change is the silly ads and even worse browser. Other than that, a solid product!"
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
"I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance."
I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
This tablet is easy to use and great for a new user.
its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
"The new Fire HD8 tablet is a great purchase for the price; it's fast enough for basic browsing, and you can download prime videos to watch on the go (which is why I bought it)."
"We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals"
Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.
"Purchased this for my mother. She loves it, just the right size to grab and go. Great buy for the money."
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
I liked the idea of having both my Kindle and Tablet in one.
This is a great product. Very inexpensive and a great gift for children.
Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
"Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8"" tablet HD"
"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.
I was a ook user and have been converted to kindle. The size is great and it is very responsive. Got one for me and one as a gift.
"I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem."
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
I replaced my old kindle as it took a power failure hit. The new kindle has been updated and it is easier to download the e-books. I am learning some of the new updates but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one. Customer Service for the Kindle is available 24/7 and they are very helpful. You can get a review about any book before you purchase it. No returning books to the library.
"Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2"" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year."
This is a new tab upgrade for me as I have had my previous Kindle for over 7 years and love it.
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
Nice tablet for the price. Just wish it had bluetooth.
Can't beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display.
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
"I had an older Kindle fire and had to upgrade as it eventually died. I love the convenience of books when I travel, along with any apps I want."
exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up
Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it.
I was reluctant to replace my previous Kindle Fire because I wasn't sure I would like it as well. I am pleased to say I'm loving it!
I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can't beat it. I use more then computer.
Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
"Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web."
I already own one but bought another for my sister in law for Christmas.
I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
Works better than what I expected. Able to surf the net and watch movies. The battery life and screen are awesome. Bought this for under 60 bucks and looking to buy more to give as a gift
"I purchased the Fire Tablet to temporarily replace an iPad and an LG tablet that were destroyed. My 7-year-old won't put it down--he can play all his favorite games, read Kindle books, and watch YouTube videos (as long as he has wi-fi access). It's holding up well. Good price."
"I bought this for my wife. She had a Barnes and Noble Nook, this took it's place. She uses the Kindle Fire daily from reading books and playing games to looking up things on the web. She lives it."
The Amazon fire hd 8 is great. Much faster than the fire 7.
"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
"if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space"
"I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more."
Got it for $60 during black Friday. I also have 7inch fire tablet. For few more bucks this tablet is way better than the 7 inch non HD fire.
I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
Good tablet. Gave as gift and person enjoys it. Recommend
I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
We have one for each of my children so I bought this one for my mother. They are amazing tablets especially for the price!
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use.
The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!
Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
"Works better than the 7"" Amazon Fire tablet I have. Better screen, faster processor and bigger to boot."
I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
"This was a gift and they love it! Its compact, they can surf the web, play games check emails etc"
This my 2nd Kindle. I am so happy with it. The price was right and I could not resist buying another.
"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
Bought this for someone as a gift. They are big on amazon kindle so this was a huge plus with other features and amazon store improving. They love it.I know other tablets have kindle apps but this was an awesome price.
BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it
"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this."
Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great!
This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I purchased this one because I heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black Friday.
Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
My two oldest (10 & almost 8) love these tablets and I love the FreeTime subscription from Amazon!
My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
My whole family uses these tablets. We love them and with Prime it is awesome.
I like this tablet it's easy to use Easy for the kids
It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for."
Got everything on here and then some!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"My kids have the older model fire, smaller version. They can spend hours on it. This is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. Each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which."
"Durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books"
"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. However, the proprietary nature of Amazon's apps basically eliminates (for me) using it for work (e-mail, document & spreadsheet storage/retrieval/editing). Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. At some point I will probably spring for a more-expensive updated Samsung tablet (or Windows Surface, if I'm feeling reckless), and the HD8 will probably be passed on to my 9-year-old."
"I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions."
Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
"My girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo"
"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
"Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it"
Has worked out well. Very user friendly. Would buy again. Great price as well.
Great tablet for the money! Thought to beat the screen resolution
My Kindle Fire HD meets my reading and web needs!!
This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
"Bought two for my grandkids, a 10 year old boy. He does a lot of AR reading on this kindle fire tablet for school. As well as play games. He loves it and his parents are pleased with his eagerness to read."
"Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot."
Was told by sales person I could come back in a week with receipt to get $30 off (Black Friday price). Customer service lady said they don't do that. I was misled. Item itself is okay.
"Great Kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way."
I purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when I was already in the store buying a new cell phone. It was on sale $59. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am already an Amazon prime member so it links up to my account. I am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day I did:)
"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
"I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve."
This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.
"Pros: 5 Ghz wifi, supports expansion cardsCons: app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround Other: the ads fed from Amazon are not terribly intrusiveOverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,"
This item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. The only con is that Amazon doesn't have some of the apps that Google Play has.
"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one ."
"Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed."
Love my new kindle bought it to replace a 7 inch and I love it.
Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits.
This is our 5th kindle. We love these. They are easy to use and the screen is a nice size. They are lightweight and great for reading.
Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
"First time with a tablet, wanted one for years just to watch Netflix and basic games. Very happy, the screen looks great and the speaker is loud. So far, so good!"
Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store. wish it had google play.
I know my granddaughter will love it. She has an older one that was given to her
For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!
I like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price compared to the others
"This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn't find it anywhere else close the the price."
Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
Best bang for your buck............................
Excellent pick up during the Black Friday Sales. Not too big not to small. This tablet bundled up with Amazon Prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment.
I had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far I love it. Didn't really need the bigger one because I have a phone that will do most of those things.
Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded.
"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money
Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
"I had a kindle for about 4 years, I've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. I can honestly say that I love my fire hd."
"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
Working great as a first tablet for my grandson. He loves it
"Very fast tablet. Large screen but can held by 1 hand. Great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. It starts CC way faster than my LG G3 phone. The display is very clear and crisp. The amazon android modified OS is good once you get used to it. I have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for Amazon mandated stuff like Prime movies, music, pictures. It's pretty cool compared to my previous Acer 8"" tablet with reg Android. Could not easily install Chrome, but I'm getting use to the SILK browser and it will work very well for my needs. Great Tablet and highly recommended."
Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy
"I purchased the Kindle Fire 8"" after owning a 7"" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version."
Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
Easy to use and elegant in design. Perfect Gift for Kids.
"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better.
My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.
Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
I bought this on Black Friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. This isn't as good as a iPad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.
Bought this for a Christmas gift. Have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.
It is awesome with low price and high quality. My daughters like it very much.
Had just the fire like HD better. More movies and better quality.
"still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too."
Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children
The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.
excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
Had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd 7 the battery quit holding a charge. Was told there was nothing you could do.
"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
Purchased this for my grandson. It works great and is used mainly for reading and games. Easy to setup with no problems to register and get online.
"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!"
"Love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life"
"fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, I will buy again"
"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
"Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but"
"Most of the Kindles I have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. It is just what I expected from the reviews. Great tablet for the money."
very good product in its price range affordable and very good
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.
Great graphics for price compared to other brands.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
"Upgraded from a6"" inch Fire HD. For 89.00 I don't think you can find a better tablet value. Resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size."
My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.
great tablet for a great price and size. Would highly recommend !
"Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults."
"The screen is a good size (portable but large enough to read) and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn."
Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.
Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features.
"We had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. We returned two and landed on this one, she has LOVED it, so much more than the others in this price range."
I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
"For the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.While it doesn't have Google play, the Amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve."
We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.
At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!
The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
"I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one."
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;
"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!"
It works great for all my needs to check my emails
A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
"For the price you really can't beat this tablet. The picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. So if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!"
Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
"Bought this as a replacement for the 7"", faster and better display.... Best upgrade"
"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table
"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page."
upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
I have been a Kindle Fire user for years. This new one is amazing. I like being able to store information on a SD card.
"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.
The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.
"I was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the Fire Hd8, I'm so glad I chose the latter. It is so fast and sufficient for my needs. I also downloaded Google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. For $59, you can't go wrong with this purchase."
"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it."
"Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc"
"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit."
I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
"I purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. I opened it and set it up for him and it works great. It's fast enough for an Internet browser, and possibly a student."
"I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too."
"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."
Bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. He's picking up on it very quickly. It keeps him entertained. Good reliable device.
"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
This is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.!
Got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. I have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. I would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.
"impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate"
"This gift was for my mother in law. Initially I had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. Recommeneded!"
"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
This suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.
"I thoroughly enjoy this table! Easy to operate, plenty of memory, and I can use it for anything that I typically use a computer for."
"Great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or Netflix shows and reading books. Video quality fine for personal viewing."
It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.
"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!"
The tablet works great so far. The parent features are nice also.
suggested by the sales associate I'm glad I took his suggestion
I gave this Amazon Fire HD8 as a retirement gift for my friend and she absolutely loves it!!
Bought it for my daughter and she loves it great product at a great price!
"Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone."
"Purchased the Amazon Fide HD8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. The display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from e-books, streaming video or online shopping. The price is low because Amazon's OS is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great."
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value."
This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
Does the job when I travel and I would recommend to a friend
This is my fifth Kindle and with each new one I have a new feature to use.
I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
Perfect tablet for my 8 year old without spending a fortune. I love how it has parental controls so I can limit his time playing.
"Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity."
Purchased the tablet because it was a very reasonable price. It has ended up being a good tablet.
I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.
"I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself."
I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
Great product. Device performed as described. Great reviews.
It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use
perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in
Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use
"I needed to upgrade from the orginal Kindle fire and this Fire works great. Videos,games, email and battery life all are great."
"Works as expected. I enjoy reading newspaper articles, books, as well as banking apps and social media tools."
"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
I installed a driver for google play store; also I payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads ($15). It was worth it. I use this thing alot.
"Easy to use, great battery life, plenty of space and amazing screen quality."
"Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it."
This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
"The tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. But for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. Good buy for the money."
"My wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. She's owned others and this is by far the best."
"This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will."
"Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot."
"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
Good cheap tablet. Great for Netflix and YouTube. Screen is a decent size just bigger than a phone and smaller than a laptop. It's also HD which is a plus
We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
"Purchased to replace the one I bought for my brother in August (physical damage). This time, bought the extended warranty. No issues or claims so far!"
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
We are a total Apple family so I was a little hesitant to purchase this when our iPad stopped working. So glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!
Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use.
Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use.
Bought this for my dad food Christmas and he loves it.
This is a great option for a first tablet. It's lightweight and user friendly.
This is just an awesome tablet for the price and the features it has
"This little thing does everything and does it quickly. It could use a case, so think about getting one, but as an eReader it does everything it is supposed to."
I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
My 10 year old uses it at school to scan qr codes and do his online math.
"Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices ."
I have always been an iPad user but I love the kindle fire 8. It has everything you need and more and so much less expensive.
Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
"This was a perfect gift for my friend. Obsessed with reading and has been perfect for starting a greater library of books... Very easy to use and extremely affordable. Very happy with this purchase, and will buy more for family and friends!"
I love it for reading magazines and checking my email.
This tablet is sturdy and great for my kids with games and learning.
I love my kindle fire it holds a library of books that I can read anywhere. I change from my kindle fire to my phone if I don't have the kindle with me. So I can start right where I am in the book and then finish up on my kindle fire when I can. I play games and listen to books all on this device. Love it
It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
"Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet."
"Great item, I can say it feel just like working with an iPad. Picture, sound, size and touch are very sweet."
"this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera"
Got this as a gift for my Mom who reads a ton. She loves it for reading and great portability. Great tablet for the price.
Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
"This is a nice compact size, and is very user friendly!"
.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet
"I love it a lot and use it daily, bought books...."
"I got theses tablets for my grandkids for Christmas, they love them."
My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.
Great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original Fire.
"My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time."
"This was purchased for my 9 year-old to play games, watch movies, and read on. When we set it up, I was extremely impressed with the quality that we got for the price! It's processor is fast enough so that his games run smoothly. Setup was a breeze, and it's very sturdy. This is a great lower price tablet for anyone looking to own a nice tablet for an extremely affordable price."
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
"Not much to say here. Cheap, fast and very functional. I was able to install google play store and everything works perfectly. Best tablet in its category. If you want something better, you better be ready to pay 3-4 times the price."
"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.
"Tablet was college student. Replace a bulky laptop. Good for taking notes, reading text books and regular books. Loud alarm to wake college student for early classes. All a round got tool for school."
its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it
"my 7"" wore out,my 8"" is much better,allthough the covers are expensive and screen protectors are hard to find. the battery life is exceptional !"
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice
Very easy to use. Size is just right --not cumbersome at all.
Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point.
The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
"I love the Fire HD. Went back and bought the Fire 7"" for my wife that afternoon!"
I've had multiple Amazon Fire tablets. They are a great bargain. I love the ease of use and functionality. The only downfall is that it is really slow to charge.
"This was an awesome tablet purchased for my seven year old daughter for Christmas. Initially, I was looking to purchase the iPad mini but unfortunately they were sold out. This was my alternative and I am so glad I did. The price was perfect and the internet and app access have been great! She loves it! The only thing she misses is the FaceTime but it has not been a big deal at all!"
Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .
Upgrade from old Kindle Reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use
"I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!"
Got this for my mom. Decent tablet not heavy and good pirce. She loves it.
Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer
"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
"Very bright display, speedy processor, and solid feel. Impressed."
"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she has loved every minute of it. It is intuitive, easy to use and she has it in her hands several times every day for everything from research for school to reading a book. Paw Paw hit a homer with this one!"
It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
Our first tablet. Purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip. Downloaded movies had Internet and was great for traveling.
Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
I purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it!
"The amazon kindle is nice, portable and very easy to use."
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8"" screen. The price was perfect for my budget."
"Great price for the internal memory size. If you are looking for a good tablet, this is it!"
"I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8"" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!!"
I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate.
I was given a fire when I was recuperating from spine surgery a few years ago. I used it for everything for quite some time. This one has a camera and plays all the latest files. I still have and use the old one as well. An excellent content delivery system. I got it with Best Buy customer appreciation money...what a deal!
We purchased this as a gift. Researching and word of mouth led us to purchase this one. Very user friendly.
"The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task."
"bought this for my elderly mother to play games, get email and pics via Instagram, etc. now she's a geek! easy to use, even for a novice and very reasonably priced. Great buy, highly recommend this."
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it and uses it every day. She's very picky about electronics and she loves her tablet so it must be good!
It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.
"the kindle is a great tool especially for the money. Fast processing, great screen clarity. Highly recommended"
"This is my third Kindle (second Fire). I use it constantly primarily for reading electronic books. Currently have over 350 books in Kindle library. Like it best when traveling as I don't have to carry a bunch of hardback books with me. Anywhere I go where I know there will be a waiting line (haircut, doctor's or dentist's office) I have it with me and use it productively to read.."
"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product
I love that I can read all my books on here and search the internet!
Being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up makes this device super user friendly!
"Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance."
"It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it's a great service"
My 15 year old is curious about adult material. But with this tablet you can control so much of the content he sees. You can even control how much he learns before watching videos and games.
"The Kindle/Amazon Fire HD Tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything I want from a tablet. Easy to use, easy to read and easy to pay for. A great tablet"
Best tablet hands down. Bigger screen and great new features. Has Alexis also. Lots of storage as well.
I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
"Small and compact, surprisingly good image and sound."
"Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone ""barrows"" a cable."
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
"With a little tweaking you can install Playstore without rooting. It's a great tablet, excellent color, fast, and battery lasts a very long time."
Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
It is a reliable easy to use tablet. Holds charge well and provides for my needs.
"I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it."
My grandson love this tablet alot of great games and learning activities.
This smokes the Fire 7 which I picked up last year. Powerful and great screen for streaming...cannot go wrong for the price.
Bought for my 7 yr old. Quality product at an affordable price. Bought on sale for $69.99.
I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's
For the money the Kindle Fire is the best tablet on the market. I wish I didn't buy my I pad already I would have got one of these for myself.
"this does everything and more the older, more expensive Kindles. I'm not sure I need my ipad or laptop any more."
My son loves it. There are a lot of kid friendly apps available.
"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!
"I was surprised on how easy it was to use. I bought it for my mother and she totally loves it, and I do too!"
"Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!"
"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Alexa. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it."
"Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend"
Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.
My wife uses this for playing on line games. She loves it
"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size."
Bought this to update the old one we have and so far it's been a good buy.
Great screen resolution and easy to use. Battery life is really good.
"This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!"
"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard."
I bought this for Christmas and my 10 year old loves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need a tablet to begin exploring google and kindle fire was a great choice.
Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price
I am very impressed with this tablet. It is faster than some iPads I have used. I gave this as a gift and my Mother-in-law loves it. Thank you
Hands down a great update to my first gen Kindle. Worthwhile!
Cheaper than the paper white and has more abilities
"I bought this to replace an older model and am very happy with the product. Mostly used for reading but also for surfing the web, facebook, etc. Love it!!"
Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
This was a gift for my wife and she loves it!! It is much better than the old one
"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
"this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range"
Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends
"Last got Fire 7"" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books."
"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.
If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...
"My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,."
"Bright screen, lightweight, great price, I love it!"
"It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price"
"Really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! I looked at the Nvidia Shield as well, and ended up settling on the Fire HD. Tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videos/movies, and gaming."
"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
It's alright to browse the Internet and watch videos.
Works great and has an excellent screen size. You cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps. Amazon blocks them although I have heard there are work arounds.
"Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price."
"I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging."
It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
Its a nice tablet however it could be better but you get what you pay for
My grandbabie love their kindles this is the 8th Kindle I buy for them
"I bought this for my son as a first tablet. I am impressed by the built-in parental app. It has a good level of control that I feel comfortable with. My son likes his Kindle. I think he will like it more when he gets used to having to get through the ""educational"" features before he can play. I admittedly need to explore the tablet more myself. That will enable me to customize the settings and the apps for him and myself."
First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.
I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
"I purchased two of these tablets as a gift for Christmas. It has an exceptional HD screen which provides rich colors and makes it easy for those that like to read book, articles etc."
One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
"This Kindle is the right size for travel, yet large enough to read. Love all the features and price!"
Kindle Fire HD8 is great! Love the the size and the graphics. Easy to use and navigate. Perfect gift for mom!
The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet.
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Great speed and display
Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games.
I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.
I got this mainly to watch tv/movies. Battery life is best of all devices I have used to date.
Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
"Purchased this on sale for my son. He and I use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the Internet. It's great for the price we paid. If you're a fan of Amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.The downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from Amazon when you turn the device on."
Really a nice item ..works wonderfully ..for the cost it's a bargain
Great product for the price! Works great and comes with ample storage.
"My kids really like this and if your buying a tablet for kids it's worth it, but maybe not so great for adults."
this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
"Great resolution, easy to use. Amazon Prime gives you free movies, books, and games!"
"This tablet was a Christmas gift for my dad. It has great resolution and is easy to use. With Amazon prime you get free movies, books, and games. I would highly recommend."
"We bought this tablet for our 4 year old to play games and watch Netflix. He loves it and at this price point, we're not overly concerned if he damages it. We bought a nice foam case that keeps it well protected. We're highly satisfied."
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
My daughter loves this tablet! She plays multiple games and has taken video. Easy to use and the color is very vivid!
Screen size good for older people. Great resolution and easy to use.
Seems to work well. Screen quality is good. Like the size.
"I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted."
"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive."
"I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!"
"Bought this during black friday for $60. while I'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. Not to mentioned the great low price!"
"I love the size of this tablet. I have an Ipad and think I prefer this size. It's easy to carry and a great size for reading. Got it for Christmas and am loving it! I haven't tried to take any pictures yet and I didn't really purchase it for taking photos. I saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. Again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time."
The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.
Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.
This is almost as good as my iPad mini. i love my apple iPad however this is a great backup.
Tablet is great does everythimg as it should. Great entry level tablet
"This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's ""awesome"", which is high praise indeed."
"So much better than my previous kindle, I've used my new kindle daily and I'm not much of a tech person. It is light weight and easy to navigate. The battery holds a good charge as well"
I was looking to purchase a tablet for my kids so they could work on homework. This is just what they need in terms of capability and size. It is a great tablet for the price.
"The 8 inch Fire is s great reader, 5 star. The only down side are limited add on applications."
This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome
The reader was easy to setup for a novice reader and email user.
"2nd kindle bought as a gift. Easy to operate, can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional books."
I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.
This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.
"Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night."
"I purchased the HD 8 to use as a viewer for my Pearl RearVision camera, which requires dual band Wi-Fi and Blue tooth. I installed the programs & got everything up and working beautifully. However I was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that I've added a 128 gb MicroSD card so I can download Amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. The price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. (FYI the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.)"
"If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!"
My daughter gets great use with this tablet. She loves to read so she gets best of both worlds. She can get her books and surf the web. Fsntastic buy
"Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned...."
"The Amazon HD 8 is by far the best budget tablet. If you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch videos this tablet is the way to go! That being said, it is fairly slow but who cares if you do not use the tablet for photo/video editing, gaming, picture taking, etc..."
I bought this for my mom. She loves the convince of reading her books on there
This product is easy to use and take along with you
"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
"Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer"
"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
We got this for our 9 yr old daughter and its perfect for her. There hasn't been any issue with the games and educational apps she uses.
I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
This is a very good product my kids do homework on it
Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.
Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
"My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect."
I'm used to a n iPad so I wasnt impressed with the kindle. I found it hard to navigate
the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
This tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. I can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. I like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen; now I can see what I'm aiming at! Easy to use and can't beat the price.
Love the kindle and the price was excellent. I would recommend it.
Bought 2 of these tablets for my kids. They love them and easy to use.
Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
This is a great tablet for anyone easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere."
Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it's expandable of 128 GB
With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
Love this tablet daughter uses it mainly and she really likes it good for reading and games as well as web surfing meets all needs !
Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.
"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
"This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!"
"Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free ""May Day"" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time."
"I've had this tablet for a few months now and i like it. The picture is excellent, the sound from the speakers is more than sufficient and the wifi is quick."
"bought this for my father, who never did much on computers and was not sure he would actually use this. He unwrapped it, asked for some games to be downloaded and hasn't looked back! He has used the internet as well as the game apps and couldn't be happier."
Got this when they were on sale last year and love it!I use it primarily to read and get emails with some surfing. It has worked flawlessly for these applications.
Nice tab and worth for its money..got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend...
"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment
"Sweet tablet yo, does good work for my grandma and super easy"
"I bought this tablet on Black Friday, when it was on special for my little girl. I wasn't expecting much from the tablet... boy was I surprised by its capabilities! Love the tablet!"
"Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it."
I love my new Kindle. Use it everyday. It is easy to use and understand I chose this a tablet.
"Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available."
Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.
"This was an item I bought for black Friday because the price was really low. I love it. It gets the job done, great travel item. $49.99, is exactly how much it's worth. The sound is low, but again for a good inexpensive, travel tablet, this is a Best Buy:)"
"Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast.gaming."
"Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it"
I bought 2 one for each one of my daughters and they both like them.
Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise!
"This is a very good tablet for the price, especially for Amazon Prime members. The display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent!"
Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.
"Got this for my wife for Christmas, wasn't sure she would use it. Turned out to be a great gift. Perfect for email, facebook with the Kids, get's her bookclub book delivered instantly from Amazon. And good battery life with a sharp picture."
"I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars."
The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!
"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
Kindle Fire HD8 is an upgrade for me from Kindle Fire 7. It has many more features and is very easy to navigate.
Can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for $60. I bought it to be my main link with my Amazon Prime. But used it last week instead to download Direct TV app so I could use it to watch the FBS championship game. It worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
"Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee."
"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel
Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
So many apps to look at hard to put down when everythig can be reached at your figertips
"Great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. Amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. Excellent for reading books or playing games. Would highly recommend."
"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
"The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great."
Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.
This is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. The price was good and it has plenty of acc.
Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
Good tablet. A lot of tablet for the money. Great for kids
Amazon continues to offer quality products with the Amazon fire HD 8 for a reasonable price.
"Good price, easy to work and the Grandkids loved ."
Wanted something small and this was perfect size .
They just keep getting better. This is great for the beginner or pro
"I only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment; music, games and eBooks. It's a great basic tablet at a low price. The SD card I added allows me to save lots music and books. The tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well."
Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Wife loves it so makes my life better what else do you need to know past that.
The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves this device .
I have an older kindle and wanted more space. This works very well
"The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful"
A great tablet for not a lot of money. Does what the more expensive tablets does for less.
Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.
"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."
Amazon Fire HD8 is great for browsing and reading. GPS system not that great though.
"I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you."
This is the best thing for reading specially on the go.
Now I want one. My older son wants one to. Keep of the good work.
"It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space."
This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for an adopted family. The teenager absolutely loved it!
"Awesome tablet! Super quick, great picture, and overall great quality"
This was bought as a replacement for my wife's previous kindle. She is loving the larger screen and the fact that it has a camera.
"Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use."
"Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints."
Bought it for myself. It is everything its advertised to be. Works great; especially if you are a Amazon Prime member.
This product met my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and portable to use anywhere.
I bought this tablet during black friday for 60 dollars and it is well worth the price. Definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet.
"This watch is not only very useful, it's very cute and comfortable. I love the fitness aspects-it motivates me to be more active. I also enjoy the ""smartwatch"" abilities. I can read my text messages without anyone knowing it! Also, the battery last a few days at the very least."
Best Buy has a good price structure for the Kindle Staff members were very helpful
"Had a paperwhite for years...The fire is my go to for news, new shows, and reading. Good book prices, credible news. Loving it."
"Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough."
"The Amazon Fire HD is easy to use. The 8"" tablet is just the right size."
"Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. Slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. Hard to find cases at physical stores."
My friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. It is just what she needed to get into the digital age. She is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her Kindlefire.
"I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty."
This was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. The different lighting for reading so helpful.
Very user friendly. For the price best deal out there.
Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great
"Have a 7"", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great."
User friendly and overall great product. Camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used as a camera so I can't complain.
Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable
"If you're main purpose is shows, books, light web browsing/social media, and light gaming -- this is the perfect tablet. Very friendly price. Nice construction."
Bought as a reading tool for my daughter. She enjoys it and also the fact that she can download apps. Great tool for school and fun
Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.
daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it.
My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.
Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school
"Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good!"
Easy to use and the HD is awesome. The simplicity as well as the easy to follow directions to set it up is great. It does everything I want it to do.
Great products as usual and great customer service
"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
This was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. I looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.
A great alternative to the more expensive tablets. Battery lasts for quite a while.
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
The fire runs well and was easy to set up. The pop up adds are a bit annoying but the tablet works well.
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
ok i did like the product very much thank you for ok
"I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price"
Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
"Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use."
"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.
This is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you can't beat it..
My ND would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad!
Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
"Gifted this to my Mom primarily for reading books. Able to check out e-books from our local library. Works great. She also uses this for Skype, e-mails and Facebook. Her grand kids also use it - downloaded few games and play. Bought this during Black Friday sale and was an even better deal. It is a good tablet."
My grandson loves it . He was very happy with it .
This tablet works well for surfing the internet and playing music.
My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.
My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
"If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future. Hindsight being 20/20, I should have spent the money to just get a new iPad since that is what we were used to."
Got this for my 10 year old son. Great for reading books and playing games. Can't beat the price.
Bought for my wife.. she loves it.. took some getting use to though but she is doing well with it
"I have a couple of iPads and decided to get this for general browsing, movie watching etc. Very pleased with the overall package. An added bonus is the very nice Amazon integration."
Bought as a gift for my mother. Instead of her feeling locked at the computer she can now access the web from anywhere in the house.
This is just the perfect item for what we needed. It is compact and can go anywhere with you.
She says this was the best gift she ever received.
My kids got this to replace their Ipads and haven't missed a beat.
"Love the new Fire - great for books, games, and getting online! Easy to use features and perfect size screen to take on the go!"
"Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could ""play games on."" She's very happy with it!"
"Never owned a tablet before, but am loving it so far."
"great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products."
"I bought this for my Mother because her Nook wasn't working any more. Although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!"
"I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up."
Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
Bought for the daughter for Christmas and seems to work great
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas (a perfect gift, if I do say so myself), and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. Alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside Nashville until I can save enough to get another one. But someday..."
"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.
Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price
"For my 3-year-old, it serves it purpose and very cost effective."
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
"This 8"" tablet is much better than the older 7"" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version."
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment."
Great size. Works with all apps. No issues yet. Would buy more.
"bought this for my son(12), and he loves it. Constantly on it. Got a great price during the holidays. Completely satisfied."
"This Amazon Fire is perfect for what I need - nice screen and memory size, really nice apps preinstalled and it's just ready to use! The Black Friday price was beyond wonderful!!!!!"
Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
"I bought this tablet for myself for Christmas! I've enjoyed the ease of use and the price I paid was great. In fact, I purchased another for my son for Christmas."
This is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kids edition of the Amazon Fire. Much less expensive than an iPad and more durable if you have a tween who isn't always careful with their tech.
This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!
Prefer no amps on unit and just allow buyer to place the amps they want or will ever use.
"Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for "" older eyes""."
"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
"Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it"
This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.
I would recommend this to other grandparents for their grandkids
this works great if you use amazon a lot and watch movies from amazon
Great product for surfing the internet or reading books!
I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy!
"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.
Was looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child. Got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case. Has worked well. Can set daily limits to prevent them from using to much. Would buy again.
"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
"I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas."
Bought it on sale for Christmas gift and we'll worth the money. Does everything needed with good functionality. Easy to use for those not too tech savvy.
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.
"This tablet is more often used than my ipad, the free games from amazon underground is cool with amazon prime and if you like to read it has plenty of book options and integrations with digital purchases!"
This is a great device. I needed something small to read books on. This device is exactly what I was looking for.
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas holidays on sale. Got as a gift for my job's Christmas gift party. The person who got it was very happy with it. I am familiar with the tablet because I bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her books.
"Good tablet for book reading and audio books, many good apps to chose from. Very good for picking up e-mail when traveling. I'm still finding more ways to use it. Only had it about a month."
My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
This is a great little tablet especially for the price.
"The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web."
Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.
I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.
Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
"I bought this as a light-weight alternative to an iPad for collecting and enjoying Kindle and Amazon Video products. When combined with the dedicated Fire cover, it's low price along with a very readable screen and the option for a Micro SD card make it an excellent choice for travel and time spent in waiting-rooms, etc., allowing lots of memory space for ones library as well as flexibility regarding how it is held or positioned."
My grandson broke his Amazon fire table one day after warranty expired. He was disappointed. So I bought him an 8 version . He had a big smile.
This serves every function I need in a tablet. Price is right.
It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
"Easy to use, fast, sleek and battery holds good charge , happy with it"
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.
This product is very user friendly and it is very lightweight
this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
"Most of the time I use the tablet for the Web, reading and email, but when I want to work on a Word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, I can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. The screen isn't as sharp as the S2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else."
"This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered."
"It was well worth the Black Friday price! The screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating."
"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
"i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
This is an awesome tablet. it is fast with great pictures!
"Price was right, great tablet for playing games and reading"
"I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use."
Tablet works great. Nice big size good battery power. No problems using it.
I am still learning all the different things I can do with the Kindle Fire. So far I like it.
Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop.
"Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended."
I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
I bought this for my mother for Christmas. She is not the most technological advanced individual. She really wanted a tablet and this one works great and is super easy to use. I went to program it for her and she insisted on doing it herself. She was able to no problem!
Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it.
Bought this tablet for a relative for Christmas who wanted access to audiobooks. My only issue is that the tablet needs a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps. Not a problem if you have constant access to wifi but my relative does not. Nice tablet otherwise.
This device completely meets my needs for reading and accessibility.
"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature.
The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
I would buy another one for the priceGood product
My teenager loves to read and we purchased it for her. Great purchase!
Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
"Replaced Kobo EReader with this tablet, very satisfied with performance and price."
Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn't want to pay a lot of money..
This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
works great for reading or playing games it connects to the web fast and responds very well
"I got this on black Friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it. It was to replace her iPad mini 1 that they have basically designed to become in operable within 2 years. She can add storage to the Kindle, the picture is fire, and she can read a plethora of books that suit her fancy. It's nice size and responsive."
Perfect for face timing with family. Perfect for travel.
Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy.
"Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff."
I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old
"Kids got the kindle fire for Christmas, pretty happy with it."
Purchased on black Friday deal for $59.99. Good buy! Not iPad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime videos and normal apps. Would purchase at standard price also as a fun extra tablet.
"Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
"I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great."
Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen
I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.
"I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out."
"Basically, the tab's features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value."
nice tabket for the money with many nice features and durable
I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
Love this tablet! Super bright colors! Great for gamers! Can't bet this tablet for any price!
"I love reading my books on this, and the Alexa flash briefings each morning before I go to work at top notch"
The kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool as well as a device for entertainment. The beauty of the kindle fire is the price. I look forward to buying updated devices.
My son enjoys it no complaints works great long battery life
holds a charge better than any tablet i have ever had
"nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs."
"love it, can do alot of stuff on it, would recommend fire hd8 to everyone"
This is the 3rd Kindle Fire that I have purchased. This one is much faster and more user friendly. We just bought our 2 grand daughters and 2 grandsons a Kindle Fire with the youngest 8 yrs old. He has it mastered already. Great tablet for a good price.
Being used to an Ipad this is difficult to adust to but does the job just fine for a low price - good size to carry around without weighing down your purse. Would buy again
This is an awesome product love the flexibility it has with not only book reading but other apps as well.
"Received this tablet as present for young grandson. While I am not an Amazon tablet fan (don't like hybrid operating system), this device meets all the requirements I had hoped for: ease of use, optional micro SD capacity, and plenty of internal memory."
"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
This is my second kindle. Love size of screen and it is super light. Great camera.
"We originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. In fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. Deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a Samsung tablet, but it was too small. This was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. This device is a great size and much better interface. Would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids."
My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.
"We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year."
Easy to use and great quality. All 3 of my kids have a Kindle Fire
I bought this e reader for myself and I love it. The price was great and the product is nice.
I got this for myself on black Friday. I have had 2 Kindles before but never the Fire. Love it!
I love the fact that is very practical and I didn't have to spend a lot of money.
Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
"Got this kindle on black Friday for a great price. It is a good performer at a great price. I use it as a nice versatile tablet, not just for kindle bok reading."
"Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners."
"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage
This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.
"I got this tablet on Black Friday. It was a great price, and being a Prime member, it has become my favorite entertainment venue on the go. The screen's not as sharp as an iPad or Samsung tablet, but for the price I got it for and its entertainment value, it can't be beat."
I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.
"The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
"I bought the Amazon Fire HD 8 for my husband for Christmas. He's never too excited about gifts but he is using this tablet every day and even though he won't admit it, he absolutely loves it. Would definitely buy again, especially during Black Friday specials."
"Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse."
"As a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android."
This tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. She has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.
My kindle fire HD8 is quite an upgrade to my old Kindle. Camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better.
Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Works great for YouTube, Netflix and adding a few games. Easy to learn how to use and no ""accidental"" purchases can be made if you use the option to switch user accounts."
"My boys love their new tablets due to the cool features, books, apps and games. I love the parental controls, processor speed, battery life and light weight. Combined with a great discount at Best Buy and you get a win, win, WIN!"
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
"If you are using Amazon Prime, you definitely like this table as it can stream the video, audio, reading book... easy to carry with you"
I've had kindles since they first came out love it
Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"
Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere!
"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
"I used daily and its works awesome, the price and performance are good I suggested to my friends , bought last yrs as well gave to my dad, he loves it."
the kindle is all way a good product for the money the hold family have one just got me the 10' and love it get a Kindle and same money at the same time
It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends
I purchased this Fire Tablet as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is learning to use it and so far likes it really well. He hasn't downloaded any books yet but he now has an email address and will soon have a Facebook account. His brothers & sisters live around the country so now he will be able to keep in contact with them.
Purchased for my granddaughter and it was a great investment.
This little $60 tablet is really good for reading ebooks and watching netflix
"My Hulu plays perfectly..great volume. Kindle starts right up so I'm able to read fine. However, when I'm on Facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. Sometimes Facebook app won't even load. I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR. I wish I could replace for a new one."
"Nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage"
"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.
Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together.
Bought this for my 9 year old Godson and he loves it. He would play it for hours on end if his parents would let him. He mostly plays games on it but he also uses it to watch videos and read books.
"Easily added apps including Google Play store... Not rocket science. Battery life is phenomenal, great for cross country flights."
The granddaughter loves it and she can't put it down.
"We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
Great build qualityGood screen resolution for the moneyCan install android applications -including kodi
Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
My husband and I were looking around for a tablet for our daughter. We wanted something that she could use easily and we wouldn't have to worry about what she was doing. With the different profiles and parental controls available we have enjoyed our choice of this tablet.
Bought this for our granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! Easy for her to learn how to operate.
"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus."
"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad."
Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Unit works exactly as described. A very good buy.
Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet.
It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes
Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
"Easy to load, works with our local library (borrow books for free)."
I have been using this for a bit now. It's wonderful. I also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading. The kindle works extremely. If you use amazon prime this is a no brainer.
Great speed and function for a small price. Does what I needed.
I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed.
This tablet works as expected. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who needs a new tablet with great battery life.
"Very good tablet my child enjoys it very much, the battery life is very good although he takes it for his games"
Delivers as advertised. Very fast performance and the kids love it
Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone.
"Not an iPad, but that's not what I wanted. High quality, does everything I need it to do."
Great purchase. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.
Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
"I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price."
"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!!
"This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password."
"Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer"
"Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value."
Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
awesome tablet. wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
"We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!"
For the money this tablet has a great display and allows you to do pretty much the same that lots of other more expensive devices are capable of.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She has been on it since she opened it.
Grandkids each got one and they love it. Step up from original Kindle.
"I recieved this as a present for my birthday, so far it has been great. I have bought several books and it makes a great Ebook reader."
This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!
Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
Great buy for my 7yr old cheap so if it ends up broken for any reason I can replace it easily.
Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend.
I was always an IPad person but after having this I'm fine with it. It's easy to use and inexpensive.
Was happy to get the toy for my son for Christmas and they won't stop playing it
"Purchased for mother in law as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She had a version 1 and she loved. She loves the better sound, picture and speed of the newer version."
Bought for my daughter she loves it. Great investment for her watching movies!!
"Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work."
Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.
I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
"This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc."
Simple to use. Great for Dad who wants to play games and check weather
"Product worked as described. No issues with performance, and it was a simple setup! Perfect for web browsing and videos."
I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast.
Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture
This is a great tablet without the steep cost of an iPad. I haven't used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movies/shows is quite nice.
I bought this fire for my 7 year old and she loves it.
This is the first tablet i have owned and i must say it runs great. And the battery lasts for a good amount of time. Cant complain when it comes that cheap.
The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
Great little tablet. Inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry.
This is a great value product and is (for me) an equal to an ipad.
great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for.
This kindle is very convenient and has a great display that's easy on the eyes.
I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children
"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
"This was an upgrade purchase. My previous Kindle was 4 years old. (still working!) This new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! Love it for reading, Netflix and on-line shopping!"
I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
"Overall I am happy with my Amazon Fire 8 HD. It was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the Delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. Not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of $65 (sale), it's hard to complain. This is my first tablet and I find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. I am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, I can see myself using it more at home now, although I will still use my laptop when I want a bigger screen. I bought it in the store & they were out of cases, so I recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. I found one on Amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors."
"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."
"Gave this to my sister-in-law for Mother's Day. Its a great entry level tablet. She loves using it, especially for games."
I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!
One of the fastest tablets I ever had. Netflix and Hulu works awesomely!
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.
This was a Mother's Day gift from my son. I had wanted one for awile. It has surpass my expectations. I love it.
"Perfect if you're looking for the basic necessities of a laptop. Only negatives no yahoo apps, no google apps, no apple app, but it's still awesome."
"I love my Amazon fire. I purchased one for my 17 year ol and she uses it to view Netflix,Hulu and you tube. I shop,email, surf the net and pay bills with mine:-)I bought an extra and downloaded my fire1. Now I have a fire 1 and a fire 2. My fire 1, my husband uses, so for back up I have a fire 2. It takes nice pics as well. The fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh, don't forget your free books you can download!!"
Bought this as a gift/prize for a Project Graduation party. The winner was super excited!
This kindle does everything i want and more. No regrets on the purchase
I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
"I'm not super thrilled with the proprietary OS on this unit, but it does work okay and does what I need it to do. Appearance is very nice, price is very good and I can't complain too much - just wish it were easier (or at least more obvious) to port new apps onto it. For now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while I'm traveling. I'm a happy buyer."
I purchased this Kindle Fire HD 8 was purchased for use by 5 and 8 yer old grandchildren. They basically use it to play Amazon games that you download.
Great tablet for a great price. No need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children
"I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money."
I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price
"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
Love my purchase of my Amazon fire Hd 8. It was a very good experience
"Love it, vivid HD color, it replaces other devices I have. Watch movies, play games, read e books."
"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.
"Good size screen and clarity for the money. Seems fairly robust. The biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. They do not have a great selection and when I put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it"
Good tablet overall just not enough memory but with an sd card just love it
It was great and great for the kids and adults thanks
my 9 yr old loves her new tablet . she had a nabi and likes this better
Love the Tablet. Wonderful battery life. Great for Movies.
This is a good tablet for the price. I dont have a lot of apps. I use more for reading and watch videos. I think is a good deal.
I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it.
it's a great tablet for the money. I would buy another.
It does everything I need a table to do. And it is really fast..
"The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!"
Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said!
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
"Works great for my teenage son. He uses it for reading, playing games, and watching movies"
I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter and she just loves it...so much I have to take on the week days ...
I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.
" I needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stays so I decided based on price to get the kindle 8 and I am pleased I did! For only $89 the bright picture, sound, storage, and ease of use is well worth it."
This is a great tablet for downloading books & movies. It also takes pictures as well as surfing the web. All in all very satisfied with purchase
Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games!
I broke my Fire 7 and decided to move up to the 8 and could not be more happy.
I bought this for reading but love the extras. Works great! Great reading options.
"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
"Absolutely love my kindle. There was a glare on the screen when I was out in the sun, but once my eyes got adjusted it was just fine!"
"I was looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range, after doing a little research I decided to give the kindle a try and it was a GREAT decision! It has so many uses and makes it so much easier to get things done than using my phone. I would recommend for any age."
"I love my new kindle. It was a birthday gift to myself. Best decision I could have made. A lot of bells and whistle. I love it because it was to navigate. Heck, I am doing this review on my kindle."
Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.
I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
Good enough for the price. Great for Amazon subscriptions and Amazon shopping.
I enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting. Good for reading books and web searching but Amazon App store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in Google Play or Apple App Store. Great value for the price however
"wonderful, I have 3 more at home, worth the money."
This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
"I am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet. I was a little worried about not having access to the Google Play store, but this has not been a big issue so far. The speed, functionality, and battery life have exceeded my expectations."
Good for price. One should not expect the quality of iPad from this product
"Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can't comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me."
Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Very user friendly
"The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!"
It's a nice updated tablet. No problems yet. Decent price for what you get
Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot.
"This tablet was inexpensive, very lightweight, and performs just as good as the more expensive ones."
"A rating of 3 starts is what I can give this product. The Fire HD8 show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch NetFlix. However, the Fire HD8 will restart when the battery indicators is at 35%. I am not sure what is causing the issue or why."
Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
My wife got this for her Kindle books so she can read on the go
"Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long."
"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
"Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet."
Great product... easy to use! Compatible with everything I want to use it for.
"Bought this for my son,, the size is perfect not too small not too big. Kid friendly..and easy to use. Overall o rate it 5 stars..no problems to list"
I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
If you want a simple tablet to watch shows and play games this is it. The constant ads from Amazon are annoying however.
Love this tablet. Easy to use. And price was right
Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for.
This is a great tablet for people that are new to tablets and do not want to spend much money on it.
"It's a very nice tablet and very economic tool, my kids enjoy it and I love the parental controls too"
"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"
"Nothing but problems after a month. Luckily I could take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad. It started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly (while the old ipad had no problems). Then it stopped charging, never got past 1%. Tried different outlets, different android chargers. Nothing. Worthless"
It's definitely a must have. I like to read books also browse social media and the web. Must have
"I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me."
Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.
"Best tablet for the money and then some, loads fast, good quality graphics too."
I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.
"If you are looking for a tablet to read books, play games, watch netflix or amazon, and to travel with, look no further. This tablet has everything you need. it does not have the greatest camera, but you have a phone for that. No reason to spend more money on anything else."
"You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab."
Great for travel when you want to read in vacation.
I really love my kindle its easy to handle to. I have 3.
"was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store."
"Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get."
Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times.
I love my amazon fire tablet. It's great to watch movies on and surf the web.
I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me
Better than nook also cheaper. If toy areally looking to use as a tablet not the best choice. Great for reading and basic searching.
Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet
"All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better."
"My wife broke her kindle, so we tried the fire and she has loved it!"
"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
I bought this tablet to replace another one that had died. it works of my purposes but one thing to note this is an Amazon device and does not have google play services installed. all apps come from amazon market.
"I enjoy using this Kindle fire 8"". The apps are easy to install, the screen is a great size. I can even use it without my glasses."
Got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that I went and got one for myself! It runs fast for what I use it for!
I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too
"Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase."
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
"Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones"
"this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school"
This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle
"Very happy with the Kindle tablet! Bought it to replace an old Kindle tablet. Great tablet, serves the purpose well. Basic browsing, netflix and amazon videos.Only issue is my older tablet had a mini hdmi not this one, so screen connect is only through Amazon echo.Still a good tablet!"
I use it to stream movies while on the tread mill at the gym
This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one
Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!
I had bought this tablet for my sister who is wheel chair bound or she lays in her bed. She gets a lot of Joy from using the tablet.Its big screen helps her see things better.
Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long.
Works great!! Would recommend for anyone looking for a good product. Very kid friendly!
WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE!
"This is perfect for him! Bought it as a reader for his books, which we either download from Amazon Prime or the local public library. Nice quality screen resolution, ease of use and durability are a plus."
"My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit.
Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great!
The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment
Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it's so user friendly she's able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance.
It is better than we expected and couldn't be happier.
We love this tablet. I bought it for my 4 and 6 year old daughters for Christmas. They have been able to used them with ease.
This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings
This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!
"Mainly used for reading kindle books, but tablet does many other things! Goes with me everywhere I go!"
When I decided on this I was shopping for something but didn't know what. After using I have decided this is it. Does all I need.
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate.
Got as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day . Really great
"This screen on the hd8 is a huge improvement over the past kindle or fire devices. The operating system is sometimes glitchy, but overall a nice system for the money."
Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads
"Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!"
"I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase."
We needed a new tablet and after some research this one seemed to fit our needs. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a tablet.
These two boys were thrilled with the Fire tablet. Every time I see them they are glued to the tablet. They both have said it is the best present EVER. Extra points to the grandfather on these gifts!
Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!
This is a great Amazon Fire HD8. I love the size. So much better than my first Kindle.
has good download speed. great color and clarity. sound also very good
"Bought for grandson ,he loves it's! He uses it daily after home work done."
it was a good buy for when the had them on sale. I use it as my travel tablet
I love this Kindle Fire....I bought it as a reader but really about the only thing I can't do on it is make phone calls. Great price for a great product.
"The Fire 8 was purchased for me for after I had a knee replacement. I used it to view and check my emails, facebook, Netflix, Xfinity movies and TV shows."
I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
got as a replacement for young child. worked well for him.
"This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I'll probably buy another"
We bought one for my son and he liked it so much we bought another one for my other son. We did upgrade to the 8 inch screen.
Purchased it for in law. She loves it and has no problems with it.
I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price
Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!
I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
Great starter tablet for any one looking to not spend much money.
I bought this for a gift and my little niece got in love with it
"HD 8"" tablet 16G on sale for $64.99 thats $25 dollars less then ever before. And alexa included."
"Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great."
Overall I am satisfied with the tablet. Nice looking screen and decent sounding speakers. Loads of content kids and adults. Nice device!
"This is our first tablet, we were looking for a tablet to get us started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started. We will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing."
"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price."
I purchased the Kindle fire to replace my iPad that stopped working. It is so much easier to use and lighter than an iPad. I wish I had purchased one years ago.
Kindles are easy to carry when traveling on long flights.
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.
"Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory."
"My grandson loves it! It's exactly what he needed. I'm very pleased with it, and so is he!"
I loved my old kindle but this new kindle is easy to use and has added security that I didn't have with my old kindle.
as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
Great for games and reading. Price was great. Great battery life. Well worth the money.
Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen.
Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone.
"It works fine, but sensitive to swipe on one side."
This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it in April. The special offers are only on the lock screen and it works with all my apps. It's very responsive and the screen resolution is great.
Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.
We got these as an upgrade for the kids' Kindle Fires. Work great and have had no issues.
"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
I bought one and gave this one as a gift- much appreciated and great price.
"I needed something that's not an ipad for basic app use and it works great, minimal glare even with a screen protector (again, it's not iPad, but it's good for a tablet)"
Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix
Very easy to use. The Kindle app works well. Regular tablet search simple games email all work fine sometimes a little slow. I used this as my travel tablet and teader. The advertising is a pain but helps keep the price down.
Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
Great Fire tablet! Speedy service and experience! Bravo!
"This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!"
Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
"This is our 2nd one, my wife was using my most of the time, so I got her one."
good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
It reads my textbooks to me while I play card games. Why did I wait so long to buy this thing? I should add that I am an Amazon Prime member so that might be needed to take full advantage of this feature. Cortonna will read all of my books to me. I didn't have to upgrade my books or pay extra per book.
"Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
Enjoy having a device that I did not have to pay for through the nose. Enjoy having a device that makes it easier to read on the go.
Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend.
"I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well."
This is a very responsive device for the amount paid
Amazon - Fire HD8 - 8 - Tablet - 16GB - Wi-Fi - Black I purchased this for my sister. I really appreciate the Geek Squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it. Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.
Kindle was great purchase for both of my teenage sons.Great for use of apps and music. Good for everyday use. Would recommend to anybody.
"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
"8 years old daughter is happy with this tables,work very well with wifi and is easy to download app."
"Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too."
Fast working tablet but very limited on apps. I like it but it was not really for me. Only apps available were from the Amazon app store so many apps that I hoped to use were unavailable. So it is good for limited use.
Purchased for book reading but works well as a tablet. Wasn't thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old IPad but working well as one.
Prior to using the device I decided to recharge it to 100% and was shocked to find out that it takes 6 hours. Unless you have a lot of time don't buy this device.
whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I purchased this as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom in Florida. I don't have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other reviews seem solid. I did watch a few unboxing videos on youtube and it seems to be a great deal. Some people seem to have issues with the screen being too glossy but other than that I don't see a ton of other problems.
This tablet has beautiful color graphics and is super thin. Easy to carry with you.
This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.
and it holds a LOT of data plus you can add more storage... been using it a lot.
Better than I expected. Parental control is an awesome feature.
I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .
"We bought the Fire as an easy way for our 97 year old mother to see pictures of the family from all over the country. It was very simple to set up and learn to use. She plays games on it, as well......"
"Cant beat it for the money, plus its very durable...."
"My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!"
I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.
Great product for my 8 year & affordable.. had 2 months & no problems
Great but I wouldn't use it for a sole purpose as being my primary tablet
A perfect tablet at a reasonable cost. Why pay higher prices for bells and whistles you don't use. The back lit feature is great for reading in low light conditions.
"I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!"
The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It's thin and light.
"Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Wifi connection is great. She mostly uses YouTube and google. Love the easy way to control parental accounts from my account. Very useful. I did buy a cover to put on it, because it's so thin, I was afraid it would break."
I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.
Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
Like the ability to play a game or 2 when I take a break from reading...
"Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag."
I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
still learning new things about my tablet. very easy to use.. perfect size.
We have been using our Kindle Fire 7 for years and it wore out. We looked at replacing it with another Fire 7 until I saw the Fire 8. The display is great and the weight is not that big of a difference.
Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
This tablet is very easy to set up and use- it's just as advertised.
I had the original Kindle and just decided to upgrade. It ​is a very functional and easy to use.
My 10 year old daughter loves it. Battery great to
"Several friends suggested I buy the Kindle Fire. I love it!! Great for traveling! I can check my email, update my Facebook status and read all from one device."
I had a new one but it stopped working....So I just went and bought a new one. Works great!!
"Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
"Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it."
This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
"I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point."
"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.
"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
"This is my second Kindle and I couldn't be happier . I couldn't believe I would be happy with something so small , but it is great And easy to take along anywhere ."
"I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!"
"Was afraid to spend so much money for a kindle but so far I am glad I did. Love everything about it. The buttons to turns pages, screen resolution, lighting, how easy and light it is when you hold it. Case is beautiful. Enjoy reading on it."
Great item! Would definitely recommend this item -- am still learning all the things about it.
"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with; unsnaps constantly Amazon Customer Services promises it will resolved in an update
"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
"I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact, even with the cover, and fits in a coat pocket. I really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard buttons. Great device for home or on the go."
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -
"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
"This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it."
"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
lightweight and convenient to use. love my new kindle
"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is."
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough."
"New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all."
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
"I read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. I didn't think it could get any better! I read all about the kindle Oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and I kept thinking I really didn't need it! Well I finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it I was sold. It is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! The charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. I never keep it on when I'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. I am so glad that I went for it and bought it. I want to read more than ever now. It is always in my purse. Believe me, I am not made of money in the least but I am so glad that I purchased this. If you are an avid reader you will be too!"
"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading"
Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against."
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
Got this for my wife and she loves it. Compact library on the go for an avid reader.
"Kindle Oasis is phenomenal... It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. The color Merlot is beautiful and I've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. The battery life is so long I have only charged it three times since owning it and I read anywhere from 3-5 hours a day. Completely user friendly."
"Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far."
"Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis."
Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable
"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost."
"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again."
"With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two)."
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read."
"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."
Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
"Wife love it, reads a lot and this is her go to reader."
"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have."
"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!"
This is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one I've ever had. It is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. I was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. It may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
"Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!"
"Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more"
"I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more"
"I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!"
"I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more"
"I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle.

"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options.

"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more"

"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more"
"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.br /br /My overall impression of the device is good.br /br /The good:br /I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br /br /The so-so:br /The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options.

I use to hate to read but now that I have my Kindle and I can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better I love to read.
"All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw"
"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes."
Great. Love it.
"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more"
"This thing has captured my wife's heart. She reads every where, all the time. Vacation, on the way to church, At bedtime and far beyond. Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with."
"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product"
"It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it's own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states."
"Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have"
It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive.
I would highly recommend them to everyone. Got it when I was told that I would get it. Very happy.
Through all of my research this was the best value for what I was looking for in an e-reader with additional options I was not sure I would use or not. Turns I do because of the ease of usage.
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
"good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this."
"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
"I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017"
Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
"I love the internet, tweeting and facebook. No computers can complete me!! My kindle takes care of all my needs ;) !!!Juju"
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
Wife really likes it. Works great& likes the front & back camera.
"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
"Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc."
Thanks. We really like this tablet . It's easy to use
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.
"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
"I purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet. It has become a product I use every day. You have to get used to the Amazon app store, which is different than the Google Play store, though it is still android-based. The tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying. I purchased the 32Gb. model for the extra storage space. It is a great tablet for under $100!"
"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
"I love my Amazon Fire HD 8. It's not too small and not too big. I was looking at other tablets, and decided on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because of the price, and because I have Amazon Prime, I purchased it online at Best Buy, and then picked it up at the store on Black Friday. It is my first tablet, and so I wanted to start with one that I can have fun with, and I am. I do have a laptop for important things."
I have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads I tried with friends were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily. This one is the bomb - I am 68 and not a techie but quite intelligent - this Kindle Fire is a perfect fit for me and does everything I want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution. I am new at tablets and look forward to enjoying learning all that this Kindle Fire will provide for me - so far each step has been a breeze. I just love it.
my daughter just loved this kindle fire. she said it was the perfect gift that she could receive.
I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
I have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. It stays charged a long time when I am reading a book or watching a movie. I just wish that kindles could run on an LTE network as well when you do not have a WiFi signal.
"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
"This is my 3rd Kindle upgrade. I love everything about it. The ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well...feels as though I am right there. My kids have ipads...but I'm stuck on my Kindle."
"Never without my Amazon HD 8 - great for reading, games and surfing the networks."
"Awesome and best e-book reader. I love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. Kindle Fire has took their e reader to the next level. Great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price."
Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
Haven't had this long but so far so good. It's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.
"I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps."
Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
"Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service"
Many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.
"Great for all your tablet needs! Email, video, games, and reading! All in one!!"
My husband loves this. He is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has WiFi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.
I was literally still using my first gen Kindle Fire and finally upgraded. I love the new one. The only negative is the speakers. My first one is louder than this one.
"I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her."
"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
"GREAT MEMORY,GREAT MOVIES,GREAT READING, GREAT GAMES,DO I HAVE TO SAY MORE"
This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
"I would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome."
Love my new Kindle fire. This replaces my old one and is just as good. Videos are as good as my tv with cable. Well with every penny spent and better deal than when I tried Amazon.
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
Nice little tablet with great features. Bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. She also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.
Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
"easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load"
Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
"I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear."
"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
"Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7""."
Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
Got this for my Daughter-in-Law and she loves it. Does exactly what she needs it to do.
i just love every thing about it. Its awesome to read
I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
"Holds a long charge. Fast great space, no freezing or resetting."
Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
Solid Amazon tablet for those invested in the Amazon ecosystem.
"This tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line, ie Kindle e-books, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.
This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
"Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage."
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
"Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
"Got this for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much."
Ok so in order to get three working well I needed to get four but the one that needed to be returned was quite easy. All is great! Kids love them!
I found the Amazon Fire HD to be very easy to travel back and forth to school. I can easily transfer my work in class to my main computer at home!
Not only did my daughter in law love it I was able to experience convenience of having it shipped!
This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
"Great value, a lot of color choices. I was able to boost up the memory for just a little extra but made the apps run so much faster. Love them"
My wife loves the tablet! She's only using it for internet so far and it has worked flawlessly!
"My daughter absolutely loves her new fire, lots of space, easy to set up and lots of apps"
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use.
This is my second kindle. Have a few more items to learn. But love it. Easy to get around the apps.
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
"New Kindle Fire 8 is easy to setup, great for reading, no issues at all when trying to connect to my home network. I would recommend this item for anyone who wants to read and get on the internet."
Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
The size is just right for me to carry anywhere and it's simple to figure out the functions. 32 G would help me store many ireader books for a long time. I have read 3 books so far.
This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
Perfect for my 9-yr old....small enough to tuck into a bag easily & very easy to use...perfect price point for no worries & has been great!!
Very happy with product. It's a miniature lap top.
This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
Works very well. Video quality is very good. It is easy to navigate.
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
Grandson is enjoying the new games on it. It's much bigger than his ipod.
this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
"I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos"
"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
"When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!"
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
"It is amazing that you can get this much tech for such a low price. This thing does everything I need, and it's so much faster than my old Kindle."
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
Great tablet for those invested in the Amazon system. Nice screen and functions well.
Just love my Kindle. Easy to use and carry around and more books to purchase!!!!!
"Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading"
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
I love new Kindle Fire. I love the convenience having books with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertips.
My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
It has such a BIG screen to see better. It loads games and books very fast!
Fast fun tablet with great speakers compared to previous fire tablet. Worth the money
Easy-to-use. Lots of books obviously but also lots of apps.
I have always had a kindle fire but I had one that was just overloaded with books and so I bought a new one with more memory. It is awesome and so fast. But also the battery charges very fast and hold a charge for a very long time.
Dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized as allow its done.Not as many free good apps Like apple have it
"My husband's previous tablet died a sudden death, so I gave it back and bought this FIRE. The sound volume and quality is much better."
meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
"Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!"
Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!
I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
"can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup."
Bought to use with Kindle. Works fine! Good quality and charges the kindle quickly.
good
Works very well! Love my kindle!
Nice
"Works just as you'd expect. Small and compact which is nice, and charges the kindle really quickly (faster than it charges on my laptop). A little expensive for what it is, but glad I ordered this."
Worked as expected.
A must have item.
Most buyers will have a phone or other charger that will work so you probably don't need to buy this.
very good
So far this product has worked great. I bought it to replace my kindle charger that was no longer charging my older kindle fire. I bought a new USB cord as well. It charges my kindle so much faster than any of the other chargers I have. I would definitely recommend this product.
Great product... Met all my expectations
The plug seems to be working well. I think it's the connection in my Kindle that is worn out!
It's okay so far.
Got one to go with my Kindle Paper white! Works great!
Fine. Works as expected.
Makes charging time quicker.
cheap - need to constantly make sure plugged in - slightly too small - saved some bucks there - not amazon quality
Very handy
It worked fine however I returned everything as the Kindle was too small.
Good!
This charger is produced by Amazon and backed by its excellent quality control and manufacturing process.
I have more than one and am glad I ordered another. You can never have too many USB chargers.
Appreciate this modular option for directly charging a Kindle.
"If you actually paid 20 for this adapter, you're out of your mind."
"Have not yet received it yet, but I am sure it will be great, as I was assure if was what I would need to go with my Kindle Voyage Reader to recharge it. I am anxiously awaiting for the arrival of my reader so I can start getting books to read. Sincerely, JudieMae"
Perfectly packaged with that hi-tech mojo. Works as advertised
"I mean... it work fine, but 20 fine There's nothing special here and it's a joke that Amazon doesn't just ship a charging plug with the Kindle in the first place. You should be able to find plenty of non-OEM chargers that'll work in terms of watts and voltage for far less money, like 5."
Perfect
turns out this was not necessary ... being returned.
It works.
"This is the THIRD power charger that I have HAD to buy at cost of over 30 each since my Kindle Fire purchase. Why can't the chargers last a REASONABLE amount of time When I connected this charger, I received a message saying that it was a LOW level charger it probably would not charge while the Kindle was in use. NOT ACCEPTABLE for this cost!!!"
Needed a new one.. the dog ate my old one
"Arrived intact, and works well to charge my little kindle."
Pleased with my purchase.

"nice, compact, shipped in the mail. works well with supplied kindle cord."
This is working very well so far.
I wish this came in white to match my Kindle Paperwhite
What can I say about the plug....it is great. Now I have the option of using the plug to charge my Apple ipod or using my USB cord and adapter that charges my pod directly into the wall port. I do prefer the plug though.
Meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the Oasis E-Reader.
just what is needed!
Delighted plus really well made product
Works well
Very good!
Just what I needed. Perfect
"Takes too many time, even being Prime"
Necessary for recharging Voyage kindle.
Too
Really expected a chord with it for the price we paid. Very dissapointed.
Easy to use...long cord.
"Yes, no problem it works great"
"Just does what it is supposed to do, Put together well and should hold up for years."
"Works great, but should have been included with the purchase of the Kindle not 20 more dollars."
Rapid charge is always good!
Not compatible with South African plug standards. Bought this unnecessarily.
Great little charger. It works well. Price was great too.
Item returned. Already had this item
Have had it for a week now and works great.
It wasn't what I thought it was the price was too much for what I got Very disappointed
Very convenient
Works perfectly.
Works well. Nice to know I have additional chargers that are the same size. I'm really glad I bought the paperwhite kindle.
Works perfectly for my kindle
Works fine for me.
Exactly as described
So happy I ordered this at the same time as my kindle!
Nice and compact. Short time to charge. Good product.
"I had to buy it, what else is there to say."
Now I can use my Kindle. Works great
This adapter helps free up computer ports so that charging my kindle is not in my way.
Great addition for Kindle
Works great
"You're gonna need this because it doesn't come shipped with the Paperwhite. Great purchase, works perfectly!"
5 dollar AC to USB power adapter for 20 buck
It works great with the our new Kindle.
Works great with my older Kindle!
Works well with kindle
great
"To date, it's working fine. I'm hoping that it continues to work it's usually not the charger that goes bad for me though, it's the cord!"
No Problems
Love it! It allows me to charge it without having to plug it to a computer.
works fine.
Works great charges reasonably fast I'm satisfied with it.
Just what I needed.
Works great!
Like having a charger specific for the kindle since only the cable comes with the kindle.
Q: What's the difference between a 19.99 Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Supply and a 5.95 5V 1A (1000mA) USB port power supply - UL ListedA: 14.04 Calling it a 5W charger rather than a 5V 1A charger is a distinction without a difference.
"Personally, I think the Kindle should have come with this item as 99 of people would need this. It works fine."
"I highly recommend this product. My previous kindle didn't have one, so I'm very please with this charger. It's much more convenient than recharging through my computer."
"Works great, reasonably-priced easy-to-use ,perfect for the Kindle . Quick charge, lightweight, compact and stores easily anywhere. Thanks for the info about unit when purchasing our new Kindle"
"I do find this better than the cheaper version I bought initially at Staples. It charges faster but not as fast as the Kindle charger that I had used for a couple years before it finally gave out. Also, it is not possible to charge and still use your Kindle, something I was able to do with the previous charger, a feature I really miss. Still, better than the alternative."
Gets the job done
Works as expected.
Good value!
Item worked fine
Works fine. Charges as described.
"These are great. This is my second Paperwhite and second charger. Thinking about a third, fourth...because while putting fiction on one and non-fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a Kindle dedicated just to recipes, another to health books etc would be marvelous"
Very ha day Very handy to have this plug I will use it what was that Very handy to have this plug will keep it as a as a extra extra one so that I can so that if I lose I lose the other plug I will have this one
Thank You
"very handy, should be included with the kindle."
a good plug
If your have the white plug it'll work
I used this charger right away and my Kindle is up and running. I like the compact size.
Very good quality
Having a charger for my Kindle Paperwhite makes certain that I am charging the Kindle with the proper charging power.
Does the job perfectly.Thanks.
doesnt do me any good without a cord to go with it
"If you are as invested into the Amazon ecosystem as I am, you can never have too many of these."
Just as imagined very good product
jUST FINE.
what to say - works
Did not have a USB at home that worked with this kindle. This was a must have.
Works as advertised.l
"Works great, just as expected. The Kindle doesn't need to charge very often, but I use this all the time for my phone. Nice to have a charger in more than one room."
Works perfectly! Couldn't be more pleased.
Works easy in every place I go.
"this should have been with the reader ,"
Excelente.
It is nice to have an extra plug
No surprise here!! Works quite well!!
Works great for charging my Kindle.
"Works like a charm, just what I was looking for."
Functions as expected
Much better than the old one it replaced.
Waste of money
Great plug in to charge my device
This. Is a great charger. I like it better than the square ones.
Reliable and well-regulated for dual voltage (110-120v and 220-240v) without too much heat generation in Europe/Asia.
It works great!
Good produt
muy bueno
works as it should.
"I got this as a replacement for my daughters kindle. It works much better than the one that came in the box, no idea why but thankful it was sent to me!"
"This is a rip-off! I will use my apple USB plug instead, for free!"
Wonderful
Work great
My adaptor doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but there are no instructions. It looks pretty simple. So it just simply doesn't work.
Charger has worked well for charging my Voyage. Comes as a separate purchase from the Voyage which I found. Think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the Kindle Voyage.
Works like a Charm...
Does what it is supposed to do!

Excellent product. Simplifies wifi television viewing.
"While I will usually charge my kindle via my computer's USB ports, I will be able to recharge the device on occasions when I am away from my computer."
What I expected
"According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced."
It's silly these aren't provided with the purchase of a Kindle. Super expensive.
It works
good buy
"Have taken this for a couple of years for calmness, arthritis, and heart. Don't know if it really helps, but it doesn't hurt. Have read some favorable things about it. This company had quick delivery."
very overpriced!
Works very well for my new Kindle.
I haven't used this yet but I knew I wanted one so I don't have to use my computer every time I want to charge my e-reader.
100 SATISFIED!
thanks
Fits and works with everything!
I don't know why this wouldn't be included with the kindle. It's like selling an appliance without all the parts
Works fine. Alittle pricy. Kindle without is not good.
This works great for my Kindle
Works perfectly with my new Kindel
"How do you rate a charger--something you need, but don't really want It works, so it is okay."
I love my kindle paper white and its easy to use 5W USB charger.
"It's a little bigger than my original one I had for my kindle fire, and the prongs do not fold up. But other than that, works great!"
Quick delivery and works!
Just what I needed
It's an AC adapter. Does it work ok YES. I have about a half dozen of these around the house. I didn't need to buy this.
I needed an extra charger for our cabin so that we would not have to pack one back and forth. Arrived just in time and on time that I got it in time for our next trip over. Works like the original.
Does what I need!
works fine
Very happy with this purchase.
"Charges good, sturdy charger, feels like good quality not like the plastic feeling you get from buying from those cheap types of charger."
"Perfect, thanks."
good product
"No problems here, although it's such a simple and common product that it seems a little pricey. Works well with charger for Kindle."
I love this little critter!
"Provided I use the correct cable, this will fast charge my wife's IDevices. Just what I needed as we have lost two Apple chargers."
Kindle was no longer charging properly and this solved the problem.
Works as advertised. Never worry about dead battery.
excellent
It works!
"Works great, as expected!"
"Five stars for charging It does not seem right to give a low rating to something so basic just because I returned the whole Kindle package so 5 stars for just being a charger. In full disclosure, I did not use it but have no reason to detract from it.It is a wall charging base. It charges."
Works as advertised.
Just perfect. Thank you!!
Excellent item.
It worked perfectly!!
"Never loved or hated one of these before but, it's great cause it works"
bueno
Over Priced due to the cost of Kindle at 289.00. Should come with Kindle.
Really have enjoyed this item.
"Works good but, you can purchase a charger with same or better specs. on Amazon MUCH cheaper. I purchased a 5 port 30 watt charger for about 1/2 of the cost of this."
Good products
nice product
great - can charge Kindle e-book reader without the need of computer being on.
"I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item."
Works well.
Excellent Product!
I don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. I just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. It's probably the new Kindle's problem but I'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. I charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. So go ahead and buy this adapter
good item
this is way over priced
"works, that is all that counts"
So helpful to power up our readers anywhere.
Works well for what it is intended for.
Didn't really need this but it came in a kit with my kindle. Can never have too many.
it works fine... it's a charger!!
Working as expected
Does what it is suppose to do - power adaptor / charger.Three stars because it's overpriced.
serves its purpose
My 2nd one. They work great.
As d scribed
"It's fine, but not necessary. Had I known that I could charge my Kindle with my tablet and/or phone charging cord I would not have bought it."
"The power cord works well however, I am still trying to see if I made a mistake in buying the 5. I love its size but it should have better functions then the older models or I just don't get it.. I should know because this is my 10 th Kindle."
"Functional, but be sure the the USB cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection."
Exactly what I expected!
quick easy to use
This is a fairly standard item for use with wall/standard US AC plugs. It is well designed and will meet your charging needs when connected to the required USB cable.
"Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket."
Pretty dumb that you have to.buy a charger port
Purchased this for my kindle and it does what it's intended to do. Quality looks fine as well.
"Does a great job charging my kindles, or anything else you charge with a USB cable."
A must have to charge your kindle. Works very well!
works perfect
It works fine.
Does the job and does it well.
Always in use!
just what I ordered - works as expectd
works and is light
Works great with my new kindle!
Always worthwhile to have 2 or more.
"Too expensive. Should be included, at no extra cost, with the Kindle."
i did not need this
Way too expensive
I thought I was buying a 9 Amp
"So easy to use anywhere there is an outlet. I had a charger that would work,so I debated about buying this. I'm so glad I did."
Charges incredibly fast. Definitely worth it. I use it for my phone too.
does what it's supposed to do and really well :)
Works Great. Thanks
Worked well as expected.
Cool
It works perfect
I like this item it suits my needs.
"Received on time, and works great . I think this is a great product. And thanks for your customer service."
It is only a USB 5 Watt charger. Had now issues with the actual unit as it produced 4.6 watts on a check load but comparing it to what is available to do the same thing there are cheaper options. So minus one star for over priced and that it doesn't come with a cable
Great product!!
Works
"I ordered this power charger at the same time I ordered my new E Reader. It works great, very fast. I was disappointed that it was an add on and not included with the price of the reader."
Good product!
Page turner. I would have given 5 stars. A little disappointed with the ending.
Works as good as the original
What Can I Say 120 volts goes in one end and 5 volts comes out the other. WOW! High quality.
Just what I wanted and expected.
My old kindle charger works fine - that wasn't clear when I bought a new kindle white. And now you want to charge me 6.95 to send it back. Forget it!! I'll keep the extra charger
I returned this with the reader in the same box.
It's a very nice charger it's fast and effective.
It fine. I wasn't aware of what I was purchasing at the time but thought that I would need it in order to charge my book. Turns out I have several of them already from other electronics. Didn't really need it.
just an accesory but a usefull one
Must have
Puts out a full 1 amp power allowing a faster charge or power supply.
Good charger
Completely satisfied. Works as it should.
Very useful
Just what I expected!
This is honestly a little expensive. And I can find other ways to charge my devices.
This was purchased for my Kindle and I like it! Makes it easy to recharge it wherever I am. Recommend this product!
Not much to say except that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
"There shouldn't be much to go wrong with an AC Adaptor, and this one is no exception."
I like this because I can plug in anywhere. It is unnecessarily expensive.
Have to have to charge the book.
"It's a charger, what else can I say."
works like it should
It does what it is supposed to do.
not necessary
Does what it is supposed to do.

nocomment
It does its job
No problems so far.
Good purchase
What can I say about a charger adapter. It works great.
Works fine. Carol
A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.
Very happy with my purchase
Great works as expected
"I got this as part of a Prime Day kindle bundle, and it works just fine. However, there doesn't appear to be any difference between this charger and the 5 other ones I have, all of which were much cheaper. If it wasn't part of the bundle I purchased, I would have never purchased this by itself."
Should be included with the Kindle.
"Works just fine, but a bit on the expensive side!"
Good solid adaptor to fit the Kindle Paperwhite.
I will know which charger is mine
"Not a cheap plug from the check out, this works for my phone and kindle without the nasty reminder that the cord or plug are not strong enough."
Helps to charge you kindle when not near a USB port.
Great product! Just as I expected!!
woks fine
thanks for an excellent transaction
Excelente !!
Easy to use.
Do not pay attention to their ad. It says the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is. If they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about. Steer clear these guys are rip off artist.
"In bundle, happy!"
It works just fine.
very easy to use
Works well for my Kindle.
"Works well! I would highly recommend. Better quality than others I have for phones, etc. so I only use this one now.."
Great products. Haven't used the shoulder bag much. I don't travel much. Nice to have just in case.
It works like it's supposed to. Use it for charging my new Kindle.
Muy recomendable.
This is some advanced ass technology.
its great
20 for a USB charger is outrageous! It should have bee free with the Paperwhite Kindle.
came on time and this is a good product
This came in the recommended bundle and works well.
The plug in part of the charger is fine BUT cord could certainly be longer.
A great product that spares me the hassle of having to boot up my lap top to charge my kindle.
"No problems, correct output."
Fern Michaels book Hideaway was not sent to my reader.
"The one I have been using, generic, is so bad. You have to mess with it to get it to work. I really love this one . Small and plugs in nice and tight."
It worked.
Met needs to replace cracked charger connection. Worked fine
Nice quick charge gives full power level. I like how it is labeled amazon so I can clearly identify it and not be confused by other chargers!
"It works! It's a plug, what more can I say"
"Just got home and found the packet is empty, there is no product we ordered in it. What do we do now"
"There is no problem charging my Kindle on the iMac, however when I travel I need a charger. It works Perfectly."
It worked as it should
"The kindle was great, however the cover does not fitThat is my fault, must have ordered the wrong one. To expense to return.Service was great and can't say enough about the Prime. Even delivered on Sunday! Now that's service."
its for a gift
"As an OEM replacement, I suppose its worth a bit more but this price is excessive. A similar product for my Amazon fire was purchased at Walmart for about 3"
"Chicago's Fabulous Fountains is a big disappointment. I read about it and expected beautiful pictures. Instead, there is a lot of print.Hamilton is the kind of book I like--history. Chernow always writes very interesting biographies--I've read several others."
This charger and adapter works just fine with the E-reader. I was so glad that I purchased it as the E-reader does not come with one.
Good charger.
Im still not sure why this doesn't come with the Kindle - and Im glad I threw it in the shopping cart when I purchased my Kindle.
good Quality
"Worked right out of the box, If I need another one I will buy one of these."
I've only had to charge my Kindle one time so far. It works well.
Great charger
Just as described.
I'm writing a review based on the problem I had with my Kindle HD 8.9 it would not hold a charge even though Amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it wouldn't come on so I'm just want to say that the charger does work when I plugged it into my Samsung phone with the power cord so that's why I give it 5 stars
really good charger
handy
Nice to have a charger that works quickly.
Part of gift
Good product.
"This charger FRIED my Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy J7. DO NOT plug your other devices up to it!!! It easily comes detached from the Fire tablet but does charge it. I'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. There are young children in my home and they know the difference between Apple and Android charging tips. So they will use any available charging cable they find when needed."
"It works, that is all that is necessary of it."
I like it.
"Quality and packaging is nice.It's a Kindle USB charger, it works what more can I say.I also charge my Bluetooth earphones with this."
Nothing special just okay
Works just fine for my Fire 7.
Works great.
works good
feel it should have come with paperwhite kindle and that I should not have had to buy it
"Delivery is super fast, and the product seems nice."
This came with the Kindle Paperwhite I bought as a birthday present for the love of my life. See that review.
goes with the kindle for charging port
Whats the point of this without the cable to charge!
love
Christmas gift.
"A must-have if you have any Kindle or Fire products! This definitely charges things much faster, and is great to have in several locations for convenience, especially if people tend to borrow your chargers."
I already have one am sending it back
I think the cord needs to be a bit longer. This would enable you to read while charging.
Nice product. Works well.
"Does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive"
"Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle."
Best
It works great.
"If you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall, and then plug the big end of the USB cable into the non-prongy side, and then plug the little end of the USB cable into your Kindle, it makes books magically appear on the screen. Use your eyes to read the words, and your eyes will transmit the information into your brain."
Incredibly fast tablet charger. Works as advertised without any issues.
My Kindle charges again.
The Kindle Voyager did not come with a charger so I'm glad I purchased this - although the Kidle Voyager does not need charging up as often because it stays charged for a long time. Mae Ogino
"It was doing a great job charging my kindle, but now it takes almost all day to charge."
I have one. It is much faster than your cheap chargers. Much faster. I also use it for my phone. From dead to full charge in less than 45 minutes!
Does the job
Works as expected
Awesome
This makes it so much better to charge the kindle. It's small and easy to put in a case along with the cord and kindle.
Should have been included with the e-reader.
"Works wonderfully, charges quickly."
It does the job.
Great product. Thank you
works great for my kindle paper white but the seond kindle that I ordered will cot turn on
The charger won't stay securely connected to the Paperwhite and wiggles. It will only charge when held at a particular angle.
Nice and compact. Better than the older models.
"This is great. So many things come with a plug that is to go into your laptop. I got this so I can plug it into the wall. I had Kindle chargers for my kindle, but I'm getting more and more things that have to be charged through your laptop. Not me...I use this plug."
Does exactly what it is supposed to do
Perfect.
it works that what counts
"Works great, don't have any trouble with this charger."
Does the job. Not often needed as the charge on the kindle lasts so long..
"I wanted the charger block with the folding power tines, but not available so I got this one and it works very well and I like it as much as the other type."
I used to be able to find these with fold in prongs wish there was that option- but it simple and well made.
Need one for your kindle...
Good. Needed product to hook up charger for Kindle e-reader.
Item is a replacement for one that was starting to go back. It works fine.
Great for Kindle.
cord is too short
like the individual charger as i do not always have a usb port device with me when i travel
Very pleased
like the firs one that folds in prongs better
Dandy
"I just use it as a new phone charger for my android, you need to buy this if you buy a Kindle because the USB they come with doesn't have this attached."
It works. Not much else to say.
IT IS A VERT GOOD ITEM
Does the job.
First rate - high quality!
I'm very glad that I made this purchase. I don't often bring my computer with me when I travel. I enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the Paperwhite.
"Very expensive charger. I think the kindle should come with it as does all other tablets, including the fire, which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just 50. It is a pretty large charger though and doesn't fit in the kindle box with the kindle, at all."
"What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time."
The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again
Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.
Great product and service will refer to a friend. And the sales man r good
very good product and service will refer a friend.
Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.
This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily.
Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.
It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!
Very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle
I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
I particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. I use it with Kindle Unlimited.
"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month
"This is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. Only demerit is - cant use in night if there is not enough light."
Excellent product very good piece strongly recommend
The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!
"In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon."
The Kindle is great for reading on the go when I can't carry around a lot of books.
Great buy! Bought it to replace a first generation Kindle.
"Perfect size, so easy to carry around. Long lasting battery life. Would reccomend!"
Easy to use and similar to using a book. Love it! I would buy again!
"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version"
My wife likes it because she can read all different kind of books
FOR ITS SIZE IF OK THE VALUE MY WIFE LOVE IT SHE USE IT ALL THE TIME
In my opinion this model is too small and feels cheap. And sd card slot.
I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!
I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.
My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
The Amazon Kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. The device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.
"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it."
"Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one."
"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle."
It is great to be able to have all you books in the same place...
"This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower."
Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
"Great starter eReader, very simply does what it's made to do."
Great way to read books available for downloads from the library
"This Kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. Sometimes less is more. No distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. Be aware that you can't read this Kindle in the dark.Pretty simple to operate. FYI there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the USB cord that plugs into the Kindle, and computer for charging. You can buy an adapter separately. If you have the Kindle Fire HDX that adapter works with this kindle. You can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.I recently purchased this Kindle. I do have had other Kindles, and enjoy them immensely.I purchased this one for outdoor use.So far I Love it!"
"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.
"After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore."
this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle.everything is touch screen and is faster than before
This devices is great for storing all my amazon books. It is also very light and portable. Simple to use as well.
"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use."
"I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!"
Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.
"Small, light easy to read in any lighting. If you are looking for a device that serves one purpose, to read books anywhere, this is for you."
I am happy as i bought it for reading and it is good.
"I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum."
I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
"I've been using the original B&N Nook ereader for several years now. I finally decided to upgrade. I wish I'd done it a lot sooner. The new Kindle touchscreen ereader is phenomenal.The device is light and easy to carry, almost unbelievably so. It is fast and responsive and touch screen has 0 delay. I would recommend anybody in the market for this one buy one immediately. You won't regret it."
Easy to navigate. Daughter loves it. It's lightweigh and its just what she needed for this avid reader.
This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
"At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light."
"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come"
I am very pleased with this purchase. It is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. This Kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. The only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.
I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.
"Do you like to read? If so this is an excellent device. There are better devices, but at this price you are not going to find a comparable product."
The Amazon Kindle is light weight and easy to use.
Very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display
"Use the Kindle apps on Android phones and tablets, but apps don't support family sharing. These Kindles are great (and inexpensive) for that purpose."
"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement"
If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
"Overall good product, bought two for my parents and they loved it!"
Am used to Kindle Fire which I love. No light to read by in the dark. Hard to navigate. This was a gift - would never purchase on my own.
I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE
This is what I needed not fancy just simply used for reading books. Easy to use and battery lasts for quite a while.
"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update."
It very convenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.
I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
"I prefer the Kindle to a book. I like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. I love to read when I travel, and this is the way to go."
"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."
Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient
I like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased
"I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!"
"Used it and looks very paper like. They integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use."
"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good."
My nephew is going to high school and the kindle is a great gift for him. Bestbuy has good selection and the price is good too!
I had read reviews. It is just like what reviews said. It is really good. I still have to try some features. Probably I should have gone for Kindle Light. Maybe next time. But for now I am totally satisfied.
"Perfect for our young daughter, its a perfect size and she can use it very easily."
The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
Love not having to carry books and being able to get a variety of books.
"It's a great product, I would buy another for a family member. I do hope they lower the price a little in the future"
This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
"I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks"
"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
"im loving this Amazon kindle reader, its the easy one to use."
"Simple, great buy for your money if you are an avid reader."
"The screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness"
I've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. She loves to read and is very pleased with it.
"I haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."
Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
This is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day...you will not be able to read in the dark
We open the box. We download a book. It's like magic. The words the phrases the complete sentences. So cool!!!
This is a great product. Light weight. I wish it has wifi to download from online.
My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.
purchased for my child to read - works as expected and for the price it was a good option
"I really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when I purchased it. It's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. It has the look of book in that sense. I was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go."
I love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me
The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading
"My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!"
"Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed."
"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle."
"Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight"
"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
"This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee."
It was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. She has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.
"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around
"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
This was a gift for my girlfriend. She loved due to the fact that it was small and compacted ..
It allows me to read without using space in my phone.
I'm an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days.
I bought this one for my mom because I love mine so much
It is very good. I like it. I will buy more items on bestbuy.com.
Great! It's very good. I will buy it next time. Thanks.
"Good, but unhappy that screen size is small, less than I expected"
It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect."
My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome.
"I use this every day on my commute. Great battery life, no backlight but very readable with normal lighting. I like the built in dictionary. Email yourself pdf or mobi files for easy transfers."
"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
This is a great quality reader. Print on it is very clear and it is easy to use.
"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars."
"I bought it cause I wanted to read more. That didn't happen, I tried and I just can't read on devices I need old school paper between my hands"
I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
"I love hear readers, I had to replace mine because I destroyed the last, but it is awesome"
"Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school"
It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.
I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
"This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet."
"At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase."
"Just what I needed, lightweight and easy to download books from the library"
easy for my kids - 8 and 11 to use the kindle for night time reading
First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi
"I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did."
easy on the eyes and perfect for travel. battery life is a +
"I love how compact this kindle is, I'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. The screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, I just wish Best Buy offered a case for it I had to purchase one from amazon."
So simple to set up a caveman could do it and still have time to get some reading in!
Kindle just keeps getting better. This device is the perfect size to pack away for a business trip to kill some time reading a book or even uploading your documents to access them quickly.
"I love this kindle. I've never had one before but I would definitely recommend one to those that are avid or casual readers. No glare, easy to use, easy to bring anywhere."
"I love my Kindle black. I can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. The functions are easy to use. Everything is set up clearly and simply. It's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. The battery does last a long time."
This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun.
Excellent base model e-reader. Nice to use inside or outside.
I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
"It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking."
Love the new Kindle. Priced right. Perfect size. Take it with me everywhere.
Very easy basic e book reader. Good for beginners to start
It is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! The background has the same look as the pages of a real book.
Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
"What can I say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. Not backlit but not an issue for me. I take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much."
"This Kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeon-holed"" by Amazon for every book or story. Having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. The need to find or put her existing library into Amazon in order to use it on the Kindle is ridiculous and annoying. Once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly."
"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle."
If you are into reading then this is for you. I didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. Great for reading outside.
This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.
I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.
Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.
Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. She is starting her first series
"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
Good product for child. Who only need to read the books
"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous."
"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
Love the simplicity. Also love that I use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.
"Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device"
"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"
"I just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one...the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page..an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole..I really just want a reader, not another tablet"
"My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books."
If you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. If you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.
"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store."
"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
1st kindle screen failed & had to reboot often. Customer Service couldn't fix. Replaced. 2nd one screen reboots often. Customer service offered replace. Just want one that works. Can't get upgrade replacement
This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
Excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.
I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.
Got it to gift to my friend. Absolutely loved it. Good value.
Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
I love this kindle! It's a life saver when I'm bored at the doctors office!
i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading
Much sleeker and touch response is better. Even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in RAM
"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
I've been using a Kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a Birthday present. Very excited recipient!
Very easy to use and with amazon have loads of books to access
Great price and works great for book reading. Would recommend
Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book
"Great kindle for my needs, it is easy to use and comfortable."
Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.
I bought this for my mom. The type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.
Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches
"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work"
"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet."
easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift
I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.
"Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book."
"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library."
The Kindle is amazing. This is my second one. The price was misleading however as I had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. Just know that
First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.
"Wasn't a fan of having to get one of these (I'm kinda old school...I like book) but, it really was a nice device. Easy to use and read from. Glad I got it!"
"UPDATE: I bought both a Fire HD and a Gen 2. (as a present to my mother in law) My initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. I merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. I'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. And see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the Kindle system.My Background: I've had 4 android phones, I've had multiple e-readers and my latest 'touch' device is the Le Pan II Android tablet. I've worked on several iPads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. Wife has a first generation Fire.The new Kindle Fire and Fire HD are the second generation color kindle e-reader/media player/tablet devices. The original Fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. It was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. It was no iPad slayer. The Fire HD raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. Jeff Bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and -in some regards- they did that in spades. In other ways not so much. (more on this below in the closing thoughts)HARDWARE:BUILD QUALITY:- BOTH are top Notch. I didn't expect anything less from Amazon but they really are solid feeling.- FIRE HD lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an iPad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold.- FIRE GEN 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers I guess. It's heavier too.SIZING:The HD is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the Fire. --- NOTE pay attention to accessories because THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE.Read more"
"I just received my kindle fire today. I had a hard time deciding between the HD, this, and the paperwhite. I decided on this one, because I really thought I'd like the immersion reading. I have an audible account and I've been reading along to the audiobooks. It's amazing how fast I can get through the books (at 3x speed) and I really retain the info. The immersion reading is super-easy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. The whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. I'm an average-speed reader and was able to read 4 books (with the help of the audiobook reading pace) in the last 30 days and one was the 800+ page Stephen king, 11/22/63.I also tested out the text to speech. It's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. It also has many speed options and I think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. I am very, very pleased with it.It is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire I'm upgrading from.If you are worried about the free offers, don't be. I DETEST commercials and advertising so much, I quit reading magazines and watching television. The offers only show on the startup, no big deal. I already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. I was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and I was planning on renting Hunger Games tonight, anyway. So, so far, I don't mind the offers at all.My favorite feature is the immersion reading and the text-to-speech improvements. I also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.Read more"
"I purchased the Kindle Fire ten months ago for my daughter. Three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. Amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. Amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the Kindle Fire so it wouldn't work. Then, once Amazon had a subpoena, Amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's Kindle Fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. Since that time, we have purchased an additional Kindle Fire and, just recently, a Kindle Fire HD. We use them like iPads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. Our oldest Kindle Fire (ten months old) just stopped charging and I contacted Amazon via Live Chat. Immediately, they said they would send me a replacement Kindle Fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. Their customer service is incredible! The Kindle Fire itself is amazing. The internet is fast connects perfectly to all wi-fi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. My teenager listens to Pandora on it constantly. I'm always reading. My husband checks the sports scores. My young sons are always playing the game apps. We have them protected in KlearKase protectors and have found them to be well-made, quality devices. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Kindle Fire to anyone of my friends and family."
"My 7 year old son has the 1st gen Kindle Fire, and we've been very happy with it. He mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. My 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen Kindle Fire for her. She had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. We purchased one the day they were announced!We've had it now for 3 days... and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find (after receiving the device) that the 2nd generation Fire comes WITHOUT a wall charger (which the first gen Fire had) and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. My 5 year old can't read very well yet - she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. Also, some of the ads featured more mature themes (ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example) that I would not want to expose my young child to.To purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. So now we're up to 194 for the Kindle Fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.I am normally a HUGE Amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Would have given the device 4-5 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, I have to take it down a couple stars.***Update Oct 10, 2012*** Interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills. While I'm sure folks are well intentioned (sarcasm), I don't recall asking for parenting advice. Many have said it's ridiculous to buy an eReader for a child who can't read.Read more"
"Good basic tablet for checking email , web browsing , and reading ebooks."
I love this tablet. It was a great buy. I would strongly recommend buying it. It's a great reader but also good for surfing the web.
"Brought my old tablet in to my local store, and when they said that I would need to replace iit, they suggested this tablet. I love this tablet as much as my firsdt one! Easy to set up and use, plus the price was reasonable. :)"
Good Inexpensive tablet for someone that does not use it that often.
I got this for my niece. I would say this product is sturdy enough for kids 6 and older. She is able to play games and watch videos on it. She does occasionally read with it too. Overall a great product and won't break your bank.
A great product for my kids and great learning apps at the app store
Purchased for my toddler. Best investment yet. Also added the protection plan. Very happy with purchase. Serves it purpose.
Buying this device I thought it could replace my phone which my kids love to use to watch their videos. It's great with applications but it's limited when it comes to kids video outside of Amazon's store.
"This is a great tablet for us seniors because it is not overly complicated to use. The 7"" screen is just the right size for old eyes. This amazon tablet is perfect for most things we need to use a tablet for. The batteryseems to last a long time. It is a great buy."
Nice tablet for the price. Got it for my son Birthday. Hasn't opened it yet but my brother in law has 2 and it works great. Great tablet for kids just in case they break it
I got two of these for my young kids. It does everything I could ask for and I can limit how much they use it. Great product for a great price
It's a great value for the price point of the tablet
I got this for my class! I love the setting for it! I have a child account so my students can only use the apps that I put! Awesome tablet!!
Great product rooted with custom ROM. Slim ROM on XDA.
Parental controls are amazing and easy to use on this kindle.
My son loves it. It was very affordable. And it has everything you need. I enjoy the compact size
"Overall this is a great tablet for the money. It does exactly what you need it to do. If you looking for a tablet to search the web, or just do basic things this is the tablet that you should get."
Tablet is good for it's cost. Works cool. Not used much so far.
Easy enough for a 5 year old to use and with the chip added he can add games to his tablet
I bought four of these for.my kids for xmas. They haven't put them dwn willingly yet! I think it was a great deal for a great product!
I own an older model but wanted to get my relatives a good and fairly priced tablet and the kindle goes above and beyond. Great price on an excellent tablet. I purchased 3 and everyone loved them and they are easy to use as well! I would recommend to anyone at any age!
I was very pleased with the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet. The product is priced right making it a great buy and value.
this is just as good as a laptop of ipad why waste money on something expensive get this
I bought this in thanksgiving day. It's good for the price !!
"Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music."
"the new kindle is a good, inexpensive 7"" tablet with nice features and a good easy to use operating system. It is responsive and the screen has a good resolution. 8GB is adequate and the provided SD card slot allows you to increase your storage capacity."
Good and easy to buy this tablet with low price! Worth to buy
this tablet works great and is a great price made great christmas presents
I bought this tab for my mother. I felt it was a great Christmas gift. She was very exited to see it and actually thought to get one. I might buy one for myself.
battery life is good. clarity and color are good. still learning how to navigate.
Had to buy Sims cards for more storage but good choice for kids
Small enough to carry and works fast enough for small jobs
Bought for my 6 yr old autistic grandson. So far so good with parental guidance.
This is my first tablet. It's very user friendly. Like the parental controls on it. So my kids can use it.
"Great tablet for beginners, nice and simple. Great price"
This was a great present for my husband who is extremely tech savvy and very particular about his choice of equipment. He was overjoyed with this. Glad I choose to stick with Samsung.
"This is an amazing tablet for the value price. It has gone beyond my expectations. These operate fast and efficiently. The screen clarity is excellent. Photos aren't as clear as they could be, but for the price they are wonderful. These are an excellent purchase!"
This is an awesome tablet. Very easy to access and read books as well as to add apps
For it being a Amazon tablet it does everything you need it to do on a general point.
"Purchased as a gift for daughter and she hasn't put it down yet.This is now her go to device over her laptop,MP3 player or phone. To me that speaks volumes!"
Bought it for my mom for Christmas so she won't use up all her data on her phone. So far she is really enjoying it and likes the screen size. Great tablet for someone who is looking to just begin.
I bought the Amazon Fire as a gift and it works great. If you want a tablet that is not expensive and will work for games this would be a great choice.
i bought this for my husband and he loves using it
"Purchased for a child as a first tablet. Coupled with the price, it's a good introductory option for streaming media and playing games."
Slow to use because there are constant popups. Barely dropped it 2 feet to the ground and now it doesn't work. Highly unsatisfied.
This was a gift bought because I have had one for years and am completely happy with everything about it.
I bought this product as a gift for a couple of boys. They really enjoy it. It also works great with Amazon Prime.
It's a good device for your kindle books and magazines. Very slow if you want to stream videos though. Don't think it was made for that. For its price is a great buy.
I purchased this for my mom for Easter - her eye sight isn't as good as it use to be but she loved to play games on her phone. So this is bigger for her to play her games and for 80 years young she is doing great with it.
"Got one of these for my 3 yr old nephew and 2 yr old niece. They are just the right size, durable and a good price point."
The kindle fire has ton of space for all your books and is easy to operate and understand. I bought it for my husband who cannot operate a basic computer but has caught on very well to the kindle
You can't go wrong when you get an amazon product. I got this particular tablet for my 3 year old daughter and she simply loves it. She navigates on it alone with ease.
"Nifty gadget, useful and easy to carry around. Just enough performance and features needed for a tablet for its price range. I would recommend this item for those who wanting to try a tablet."
No worries with this tablet. It's easy to work and has all the functionality of the big boys.
I bought this as a replacement for my original Kindle Fire I bought 4 years. ago. This has more features and many upgrades for 1/3 of the cost of original Kindle ! The technology we have now days is unbelievable ! Thanks Best Buy for a great product that I can afford !
I needed something to read kindle books on and to watch occasional videos with. This inexpensive tablet packs a lot of features for a great price. Does everything I ask of it.
"Incredible value - at $49.99 this tablet is a wonder. Easy to use right out of the box. I'm not a techie, so ease of use is a must. Watch movies, read e-mail, download a book, listen to music and much more. Small size makes it easy to carry in your purse. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
For $50 dollars I would buy this tablet 99 out of 100!
"I already have a Kindle Paperwhite, which I don't leave home without. I now have my husband hooked on the Fire 7"". I have used it a little, but it it primarily his. He really likes it. Easy to use. Nice large display."
I love being able to read on the tablet and not have to use the battery on my telephone.
I love my fire tablet . I even got one for my son who had a Digiland & this tablet outdose it. Love it!
Great product kindle fire got one for mom and dad for Christmas presents nice to add storage
My wife loves her new Kindle Fire. Great add for the front a rear facing camera as well as the basic features. Another add for this devise is the added storage option.
"I love my kindle.,for the price this thing is great and does what I need it to do"
this is great for the price. It is slow on certain application.
"The battery life isn't great and it needs more memory. But the value is pretty good, and my kids love it!"
purchased to replace an old tablet to have around and for children. everyone likes it
"My son and I wanted to find a small tablet to watch videos on and do some basic internet browsing. This tablet fit the bill perfectly. We weren't looking for all the bells and whistles and wanted to find something in our budget. At $49 this little piece of Fire is amazing. The graphics are great, not HD but still great. The speed is acceptable and otherwise it's easy to use. I love the dimensions, it's easy to carry and not heavy. Absolutely Love it!"
"This tablet was a gift to my nine year old and he loves it nice resolution fast, and slim. Cant beat it for the price."
Bought for my 14 year old and she loves it. Reads books on in all the time
We got this mainly so that my husband could listen to music while getting ready for sleep. Really works well.
If you just want a tablet that gets the job done. Then here you go.
"I picked up this tablet when it was on sale. It wasn't a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an iPad. But for the price, the tablet is very powerful. With Amazon prime I could do much more than I expected. My complaint is that the front facing camera zooms too much on your face. Also, there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve. But it is definitely worth buying as a backup tablet."
"This is the third fire in our house now and they're all solid, if unspectacular. For $40, the hardware can't be beat, but this newest version of the operating system is very clunky and not intuitive in the least. Once you get over th leading curve though, it's a good way to keep the boy quiet on a plane"
I like the tablet. We got it for my nephew who is 5. He can easily use it daily. He has a lot of educational games downloaded and it stays charged for awhile.
My daughter fell in love with it instantly best ever
"You won't find a better tablet for the price. Tried multiple different tablets in the same price range and the amazon fire outperformes them all in every category. If you want a good tablet and on a budget, this is your tablet!"
"Bought this as a gift for mother's day, after her several attempts to use lower quality tablets that died quickly. She likes the size for her hands. Convenient for her to carry and use. Quickly gets email and plays her games."
"I think that this tablet is only good for reading books. It's not very fast, so you won't be able to do anything else."
"I purchased the Kindle Fire for my mom as a Mothers Day present, and she loves it."
It was easy to set up my Amazon account and I was using within minutes. Great for travel and being able to read any of my books.
need more expects on tablet & computer with nohow.
"I like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. The colors are vibrant and crisp. It plays videos well. I love the Amazon Underground absolutely free apps and games. The only drawback for me is the Amazon modified Android OS. I'm slowly figuring it out. The cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason I bought this. It is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. I also bought the tempered glass screen protector."
"I am enjoying my Amazon seven inch tablet. It is fast paced with good graphics and long battery life. The main problem is that the volume is lower than other tablets. Still,great deal for the price."
Great item for my kids are you recommend it to anyone that wants to replace an iPad for their kids
This is a very good tablet which has power CPU and lots of features. I glad I purchased it.
Great tablet. Phenomenal value for the money. I've bought one for everyone in my family.
No problems so far. Used by my 15 year old to play games and browse the Internet.
"Great for music ,movies and games a lot of space 7 inches"
"This is a good product for a good price. Please note my use of the word ""good"". The Amazon Fire tablet is not the best tablet on the market but it is a good deal for a low price. I bought this product as a gift for my mom and she likes it. It gets the job done. She uses it occasionally to read during her morning commute on the train or in a busy waiting room. This is not a product built for heavy use."
I bought this to download videos to watch while going on a long road trip. It worked perfect for that.
"This tablet give you the opportunity of everything, surf the web, email, music, games, etc."
"Bought the Fire for my 86 year old mother. Yes, she's 86 and still works part time at a museum. Her co-workers communicate at times with emails and she was not able to participate. The Fire was the perfect answer for an inexpensive and easy to operate device to keep her in the loop with all the upcoming events. The Fire is easy to operate and wasn't too intimidating like a laptop or desktop. Mom has caught right on and is using it daily. Great choice for a beginner. Very happy it's working for her."
LIMITED CAPACITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A VERY GOOD BUY
"The apps I really want it won't let me download. I don't like that I HAVE to sign up for ""One Click"" with a credit card."
"He was amazed that he can serf the web, go onto face book, place amazon orders. Read books so quickly.Play games and likes the front and back cameras."
THIS A GREAT PRICE FOR THIS SIZE TV IT HAS EVERYTHING WE WANTED SMART 4K
"I bought this because I did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet. For $50, I really have no complaints. I am able to install thousands of apps, browse the web, watch movies and so much more for such a reasonable price."
then you have a beast of a tablet. Especially when you can catch these on sale for $39.95
This is a great tablet especially for the price. The only draw back is that I could not load an app that I needed for work because Kindle does not accept google play apps.
Bought 3 off them all together go get your now works good when shopping online
Wanted to get my wife an upgrade to her old Kindle and this was it. Works great and she likes the fact that it is in color.
Great tables for kids. I haven't had any issues with them
The 7 inch Kindle Fire is just right for me to put in my purse to take to appointments at the Dr office or anywhere you have to wait. I have really enjoyed it and have bought 3 for relatives and friends
I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.
For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.
This is a great first tablet for kids. Lots of game and the battery life is good!
We have a first generation Kindle that stopped taking a charge so I decided to get one of the newer cheaper models at my local store. He loves it and it plays more games now that it's got a faster processor.
Purchased three tablets for my kids and I have not been disappointed. I am considering purchasing two more.
We bought the tablet to give as a prize in a baby shower contest. We thought it was a good price and we decided to purchase.
If you want an easy way to read a book or check out social media then this item at around $50 is a steal!
Great price for tablet. Works great for my 3 year old that loves trains so can watch all the train videos on Amazon Prime and can limit the time with the FreeTime settings on the tablet.
"We bought this tablet for my son to do his homeschool classes on, and he loves it!"
"The Kindle Fire is great device for the whole family. My daughters and I use it to read on. You can change the size of the font, and the background color and brightness. In addition my son uses it for games and my husband to check sports scores via the Internet."
"I got this as an upgrade for my old kindle & I love the new features! Crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations & tabs. Well organized. They added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. When reading it learns your pace & gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which I think is neat. Can watch Netflix/Hulu. All around great product in my opinion."
Its a beginner tablet. Not so great interface. I prefer larger size tablet
Bought the new for Father's Day. Works well sometimes have to reset it to connect to Internet. All the apps are easy to access.
i mean if you want just a tablet to read some books and browse internet thats fine.
This tablet is great for games and books. Good size for travel.
"I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like the tablet. I had watched the prices go up and down on Amazon. I wish I had bought one when they were $29.99. I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later. I have been using my Kindle touch for that. If you do buy this tablet I would suggest getting a memory card."
I use it for games and movies...its great..good picture quality....great sound...could use more storage space..but i guess thats why they make sd cards...
It's so much better than her viewing on her tiny phone. Great price too.
Love this tablet easy to use. Wonderful color and compact enough to carry.
"This tablet is pretty cool, and reasonably priced. Easy enough for kids to use and I would recommend for those interested in buying one that don't wanna spend a lot."
"As I said, The item worth more than the price. It was emailed/introduced to me by bestbuy.com and I am lucky to buy it."
This is a great tablet for the price. Works great and is easy to operate.
This tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share (ages 4-8). Their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. It was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the Amazon App Store. Screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick! Our only regret is that we didn't buy the 3-pack so that they each could have their own instead of sharing! Great performance value and much appreciated gift!
Bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. She loves it. She's been playing on it since she opened it.
Nice tablet. I purchased this tablet for my mom as well as my daughter they both love this tablet. Good for general web surfing and loading books.
This device is OK for reading or listening to audiobooks via Overdrive app. Wouldn't recommend it though really. Waited to buy Kindle for years. Would suggest doing research before buying this device.
Bought Fire tablet on impulse and not sorry. Like much better than my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Felt 8 g was enough storage space since they've now added external storage space.
I got this gift for the wife for a starter tablet and she loves it!
"For the price this tablet is a very good choice, purchased one for my girlfriend and I and are very happy with them. Good processing capability and resolution is what is expected."
This is a very good basic tablet. The resolution is excellent and is great for reading or surfing the Internet. The only annoyance is the adds that pop up on the home screen.
I got these for my children for Christmas they are great for them for the size
"Apps for square, PayPal, and such not available bought thinking best option for business. Not so. Needed inexpensive great. Need certain apps check before buying."
Sturdy item great value for price. User friendly. Highly recommend.
Nice tablet for my eight year old son. Very light and easy to set up.
Great tablet and price for my four year old she really enjoys it
"I love my new tablet! So easy to navigate and set up. Have used a little so far, and have no issues with any of the apps/ installed programs. Lots of things to do."
Great tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs to do with it and easy set up. She loves it. Might be the best present she got for Christmas this year.
Works well but too much advertisements with little control over content.
does everything i need it to do for my business needs
Bought this tablet on black Friday and I'm very happy with it. Haven't even touched my ipad since buying this little guy.
Christmas presents for our girls. They work really well.
Love shopping at Best Buys. Better deals than Walmart.
Affordable and easy to use. Holds my books and my games
Just needed a small tablet for video and surfing. Perfect.
"Got it for my granddaughter, she loves it, great for games and internet"
This is the 2nd Fire I purchased. Had to return the first due to a flaw creating an inability to connect to wifi. So far this one works great. Use it mostly for reading.
Great product for my seven year old granddaughter.
"I got a great deal on this and bought it. It does the basics. No more. No less. The display is below average, at best. And the Amazon App Store is a bit clunky. But you get what you pay for and I'm satisfied."
I bought more than 4 of these for our kids and they were worth it!
"This little tablet is amazing for my 7 year old! He can play games, watch movies, and read books! Most everything is free but there are some games, books, and movies that you have to buy. I'm super impressed! Great battery life too!"
Cheap and works great awesome beginner tablet amazon did a great job affordable and great for something just to have and play with
Such a great tablet! Got my mother it for Christmas and she loves it!
I bought this table for my 8 year old nephew and he love it a bit small but for him its good
No bad for the price. The bad is the got too many adds an you can't take it out
Not Kid friendly at all. Purchased for little nephew. Wasn't given any info on it for sales person either. Took back!!!
"Able to read book and use apps like Netflix. Feels slow when you are used to using an ipad, but obviously there is a big price difference."
Screen was cracked but the package did arrive earlier than expected
For the price a decent tablet. Some apps don't want to download.
I LIKE IT BUT WHAT I DONT LIKE ARE THE ADS THAT HIDE AS SCREEN SAVERS. INTRUSIVE.
My other kids have a tablet like this one and my youngest wanted one. They all love having their own and really like these. They were not a bad price either.
"I just want a small tablet to check news, weather etc from time to time, and this product works well for that purpose. It is not as fast on my iPad2 but it is a good choice considering the price."
Happy with quality and resolution. Would recommend
good product for less price.Best deal from bestbuy
"good tablet for kids, basic functionality. not much memory"
No bells or whistles but does what I want for the price.
So far so good. Display is not as bright or clear as my iPhone but then again I only paid 30 dollars for the tablet
Thank you for the gifts and thank you for the great customer service.
I bought this for a friends daughter and she loves it she is 10.
I bought several of the Amazon Tablets as gifts and my family and friends were ecstatic! I have not given a gift with such great reception in a while.
I thought the size was a little small bit besides that it's nice and battery is good
"It is a good entry level tablet, especially if you already has Amazon prime.A lot of power for the price. The only consideration is that is only has 8g of storage."
Can't complain about a very inexpensive tablet. Got it on black Friday for a great price. Works great
"I purchased the 7"" and 8"" units at the same time. They are both nice little tablets for using the Amazon apps and cruzing the internet, but the 7"" is lacking the additional 512Mb of ram an 8Gb of storage that make the 8"" worth the additional money."
Works very good and fast!!! Great screen resolution.
Great smooth tablets with many apps to choose from
The tablet works great! No problems or concerns! Great for kids also.
Purchased as a secondary tablet to my iPad so that I could have an inexpensive one to use that I didn't have to worry about ... Easy to set up & has great speed.. Like that it has expandable memory!
Very good tablet and it works very well. Easy to use.
It's the best price media streaming tablet on the market. I watch everything on it.
"this is a good one, easy to read and browsethis is a good one, easy to read and browse"
the description sounded like the base unit was included with the coding game - which it was not.
"Good for what it is supposed to be- not a high-end iPad for sure, but for the price, can't beat it. Gift for my son, a low risk way to acclimate him to tablets, but not a big loss if he destroys it. Relatively speedy, good resolution, OS takes a LOT of getting used to after iOS... parental controls were a nice addition."
"This is a nice low price entry point into the tablet market. Some folks use them allot, while others don't. This is a non-expensive way to find out."
I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think. The screen and sound quality isn't super HD but it's acceptable.
I bought this for my God daughter whom just wanted to FaceTime on Facebook messenger. Works great for the price.
"my daughter really loves her kindle fire,awesome choice"
Bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas as they were always on mine.
easy to read and great resolution. will probably get another for a family member
I bought two of these tablets for my twin boys bday! They just turned 8 years old on Aug 22. They really like them. Also the graphics are awesome. I really would like to get the purple for myself.
"Does exactly what you wanted to, very nice looking seems to be a solid product"
Perfect tablet for beginning reader. Great for games and videos.
Not really much to say here but it does the job. I'm not use to the Amazon store as I am with the Google store but I can live with it. This was a spur of the moment but where I wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot. And so far it has been my traveling buddy. For the price it is good and does what it should without to many compromises; ( ads) if your not looking for a lot nice stop.
I got this because it was much cheaper than the iPad and it supports flash. The bonus comes with the ability to binge on my Netflix series and listen to music.
This is not recommended if you have inpatient kids.
This was a gift for my granddaughter. She absolutely understand how to use the tablet and totally enjoys the product. Excellent charging time and last her all day. Best buy had the best price out of the 3 nearby stores. Staff was very friendly and efficient.
Needed something smaller than my Samsung 10 inch tablet to carry around and this worked great.
Good My wife likes it better that the more expensive ones and other brands
nothing to say about this product...bought as a gift
Price was right and works like a champ. Bought for my mom and she loves it
The kindle fires have been great for the grandbabies.
This tablet is just the right size for travel and the kids.It has the Amazon app store and user interface and lots ofgreat features. Auto uploads pictures and videos to your Amazon cloud.If you have Prime you can watch Amazon prime Video too
Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.
Got this for my nephews and they love love love it!
Love that tablets bought the tablets for friend that love it
"Great screen, fast and responsive touch controls, and linked to Amazon for your apps. Overall, the best tablet you can find for under $50."
This tablet makes for the perfect gift! Highly recommend
Inexpensive beginner tablet for little kids. Has anything they can ask for for a good price. Amazon did a good job on offering technology to practically anybody.
this was just ok... wish the camera quality was better.
"As the title says, the tablet isn't bad for the price, good enough for books and just browsing the internet."
better than original kindle fire. definitely more functional
"Excellent! New kindle fire tablet. This one better. Has camera, camcorder, and more organized"
Bought for my daughter for middle school reading. It's perfect
If you can afford to get the HD versions I would go for those; however this is a great starter kindle. Love all the parent controls!
"Like the product, takes a little time to restore previous data"
Item was bought as a gift I haven't used the device seems my 6 year old was enjoying the games he downloaded
"I bought this item for a kid and she love it,, best of all the color make the product well like able, She claimed that it is fast and the parent is able to set up parental control.Parental control help parent to monitor activity easily"
I love the tablet so does my 2 year old she watches her shoes all day long on it its very user friendly
"Tablet is a great size to hold and allow children to play games on (such as ABC mouse), and even got Pokemon Go to work on it after some fiddling. Only complaint is how much needs to be on the system storage, even when having a large SD card, so that limits how much you can have."
I bought this tablet for my almost 3yr old. We didn't want to splurge on an iPad and this was a great price. We love to read books on it and watch movies in the car!
"I bought this tablet with the desire to Root and maybe flash a custom ROM. While you can down grade to a previous version to root with kingroot, you can no longer flash custom roms. Still happy with purchase. This is my 3rd Fire 2015."
"Amazon typically makes good quality products for a decent price, so this tablet on sale for $35 was a no-brainer. Plus, it's easy to install Kodi and the Play Store without having to hack the device."
It's easy to operate pluse is good price range. It's great for teens.
"I bought this to replace my NOOK HD 7"". Screen is way better than the NOOK HD."
Bought for my youngest daughter. She loves it. Will buy again.
"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services."
My grand daughter has her educational apps on her tablet and enjoys them tremendously!
"I purchased this tablet for my granddaughter, and she can't put it down!"
For the price it works fairly well. I would recommend it for a novice or first time user.
We have gotten new Kindle every year grand children love them
Happy with product especially at this price. Easy to use and small to carry with me
Amazon has made a device that's very easy to use for a first time tablet user like myself.
The Fire is a fantastic tablet and is so economical. My granddaughter loves it!
The Amazon fire is a great inexpensive tablet. I only wish that it had a more true version of Android. There are some games and apps that won't work on the fire because of how much Amazon has changed the Android OS.
"I was amazed how little it cost to get a Kindle Fire these days. I passed down my iPad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and I just wanted something to watch Netflix and read books. The big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership. It's noticibly slower than my old iPad, but for $50 I'm very happy with it."
"The tablets that I purchased have worked great for their purpose. Only problem I have is a couple glitches I keep running into. It's frozen up twice. I end up having to wait til it dies to restart it. Kinda sucks but other than that, my kids love it and I'm happy."
Bought for my 6 year old. I recommend using a third party case. The kindle one is great for impacts but it pops out with a simple twist.
"Tablet has many features. Great Tablet for reading, storing your resume, surfing the web and downloading books. The price is amazing"
The tablet works well. Do wish it play store. It is easy enough for him to use.
it is a good table for children and it has a good price.
PURCHASED FOR A 92 YEAR YOUNG LADY TO BE ABLE TO PLAY BEJEWLED BLITZ. SHE LOVES IT !
"I love this tablet. It does everything that I wanted for a tablet when I was comparing between different brands. The only thing that I should have done was, purchased the 16 gig version. The space goes quickly."
I purchased this tablet for my 5 year old. It is easy to use and i love the Kindle Freetime. Great price. Pretty durable.
We recently bought all our grandkids a tablet to have of their own.. great tablet to play games on and educational things as well.
I like it I got it for my nephew birthday now I can get it out off his hands
"It is small,lightweight and fits easily into a backpack"
Perfect size for playing online games and searching the web.
Easy to use. I would recommend to others! Have friends who will buy one!
Bought this for my nephew who reads a lot. He likes to download books and play games. Great price for the quality.
I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well
My wife and I are so happy with the range of functions on this product that we bought one as a gift for her sister. Love the clear and crisp screen and ability to navigate easily.
"You won't find a better value. Especially if you are a Prime member, this device is a fantastic basic tablet. Worth every penny."
This is a great tablet for the price and is easy for my kids to use they love it
This is nice tablet with great functions. Great for reading books. Fairly easy to use on the web. Lots of Apps available.
My son has enjoyed using this to read books and stream the internet. The price was great too!
These are perfect for kids to use and have some nice features for only 50 bucks. I recommend.
"is simple and easy to use, also is perfect size for my purse or a carry on bag"
This is my 4th Kindle and my 1st from Best Buy. It was much easier to purchase on line and pick up at the store a short time later.
"Our six year old grandson wanted a tablet to use when he visits. This has all the features we were looking for, it is secure, only allows the kind of educational and fun applications we approve of."
Needs to have some hardcopy instructions in the package..
Son loves this tablet kid friendly tons of games very pleased
This tablet is so easy to use for all ages. Already comes charged & ready to use.
Got this during the deal of the day for a great price. My son loves it and has downloaded plenty of games to keep him busy. Small enough to fit in my purse or a book bag and keep him busy while on car rides or in waiting rooms.
"this I ,y grandson's second tablet. his first was a nabi. this one is very easy to use and setup. can also use parental controls. he and I both love it!"
I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!
It's ok. I love that I can set up my 5 year old on his own with the children's setting. The battery dies really fast though. We can't even make it through a long car ride without having to plug it in.
I got this for watching movies on the go. I just put a bunch of movies on a micro sd card and it plays them. Good value for the price.
"This tablet is awesome! I use this tablet to look at my emails, check facebook, browse the internet, playing games, shop a little and of course, read books. Does all this with ease, and I don't have any issues or problems. Lots of apps to load with ease. Great product!Overall, This Kindle fire works great and meets my needs. I could not be more happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!!!"
I bought this tablet to watch my recorded TV shows while I am at quilt retreats. I also can watch Netflix and Amazon prime. I like that is takes a micro SD card!! Picture and sound are very good!
"Made this purchase for my daughter. She is used to iOS but was able to figure out the differences very quickly and had no issues. Its great to have a cheaper tablet for her movies and games, especially during road trips"
"I was looking to bu an affordable tablet but with all the necessary features and this tablet is great. Good touch, display and speed. Very happy to buy this but would have been happier if I would have got some discount."
Pro's GPS accurate--easy to set-upCons small screen--does not count stairs adequately--would not push notification to my Samsung 7 edge
"Can't beat the price these are going for, gets the job done."
The picture is crystal clear. The resolution is amazing given the price.
Bought this Kindle Fire tablet for my 8yr old and she loves it.
Wow - for 49.99? You gotta be kidding me. What a great buy for the money!
Great price fast delivery will be buying from Best Buy again
"Have you considered buying a kindle for your kids? This is the one to get. Anything else and you're over spending. Pros:Great app selectionGreat free apps due to UndergroundExtremely affordableSD card supportCons:Bad storage management - when you run out of internal space, the device stops functioning correctly!"
Great product for beginners and senior citizens. Simple to operate.
"Great little tablet for the price !! Bought it for the kids when they come over, can't beat it!"
Small and cheap gift for my nieces who like to listen to bible stories
"A very good handy tablet, good product for the money, excellent integration into AMZN universe of fire tab/website/prime etc, fast and easy to use,"
Pretty easy to use...small enough for little hands...nice as card slot toExpand memory
I love my Kindle. Wish it had more memory but overall it's the best electronic thing I have purchased for myself.
"All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)"
Not a bad tablet for the price. Iris skittle different from other tablet brands
"Have wanted some type of Kindle for quite a while, especially for reading the many free non-fiction history books I've downloaded for my genealological research. Couldn't pass up the sale price on this model and it is everything I hoped for."
This tablet is the perfect size for kids. It's great for adults too if your looking for something not so big.
"I use my Amazon fire tablet to allocate kids to watch TV through my TWC app, as well as to download and stream music. If you are a heavy Amazon user this app is perfect for you. Holds charge for a decent amount of time as well."
I got this kindle fire for a Secret Santa gift that my family does each year! I was so excited when I was able to get it on sale which made it in the price range of the Swap! This was a huge hit and he continues to use this today a year later!
My granddaughter loves it best thing ever I highly recommend it
Great price .. great tablets for kids .. recommend the tablet
I bought this for my son. He likes that he can take it with him where ever he goes. Great quality for the money. I paid 3x this for my kindle and this one does everything mine does. I'll be purchasing more as Christmas gifts.
We got these tablets for our 4 year old and 9 year old and they love it.
"Use this device everyday. So much easier to carry than an iPad. Plus, Alexa is amazing."
I brought this for my 3YR OLD and she loves it. It'd very easy for her to use.
I bought it for my nephew. The processor is quick. Good tablet for that price.
I love the Amazon Kindle Fire. Great buy! I use mine all the time
"the only thing this needs is more space. The tablet works great! and adding apps was easy, it just did not have enough space for my endless amount of apps I use. but my granddaughter plays with it all day!"
"Really like my Fire 7. Specifically bought it for a vacation so I could read and check my email for my business. So far I love it. Only downside is the connection speed is somewhat slow. When connected through WiFi at home, it is slower than any Laptop. Also, if you want to play games, I highly suggest the larger version. Hoping my husband gets me a stylist for Christmas to make some of the games a little easier."
Its a good product at a good price. I got it for my 8 year old and it serves the purpose.
Great little tablet. Price was great! Can do almost anything on it just like an ipad but cheaper!
"This is a good kids 1st. Tablet and for a price that wouldn't be too damaging if it happens to ""fall"" or ""malfunction."" Just be you install all the parental apps needed before you hand it over to them."
The bigger screen it so much better to do anything on. Games and movies are better because you can actually see them.
"This is a superior product. Easy setup, easy to use. Reasonably priced and great for the book worm who loves reading."
"Don't bother wasting the extra money on the official Amazon Kids Fire Tablet, we got this with a nice case and 32 GB SD card (both of those from Amazon) for cheaper than the bundle price from Amazon directly."
"No matter if full priced or on sale, this tablet is definitely worth it. Pop a microSD card in and don't look back. Paired with a Prime membership you will be able to read, shop, watch all that Amazon has to offer. I purchased a couple more as gifts after using this for a couple of weeks."
Got this for my mom who wanted to read and use it for apps. Perfect tablet for that and the price is great. You can't go wrong with a Fire Tablet.
"I bought 2 of these tablets for my kids on their birthdays. Very easy to set up and use. Also very easy to use and monitor the kids usage and controls to what they download and watch. Great part is anytime they download something, an email is sent to the parent notifying them what was downloaded."
My mom loves it. She doesn't even use her chromebook anymore. I love my new chromebook shhhhhh.
I love this tablet. This is the third one I have given out because I liked mine so much. the price is just right and value is out of sight
I bought this for my 11 year old nephew and he uses it a lot.
We bought it for my son but the whole family uses it. We really enjoy it
easy to use and quality product for the price. primarily use as an e-reader
"Amazon makes this tablet a no brainer. The performance and price are unmatched by any other tablet on the market. As and entry level tablet with all the entertainment extra Amazon offers, it is a great deal."
Purchase this kindle fo your child and they will LOVE you! Seriously!
I purchased this for my 6yr old niece and she absolutely love it.
Great tablet and great for the kids and simple to use and set up. I got 5 for my nephews and never had a problem with them.
This tables is fast and easy to use. I love the reading books in it and watch movies.
"The Amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason, it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it. I had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen."
We bought 2 of these for Xmas kids love them great
"I bought this for my 3 yr old grandson & it has taught him his ABC's, his numbers, his colors, animal sounds and more!! Very kid friendly and he loves his "" tabo"" as he calls it!!"
We bought two of these for Christmas for our girls and they have been great. Educational apps are easy to find and utilize plus Amazon prime access gives great selection of movies etc. frustrated with too many ads though so I only gave it 4 stars
"I have used other e-readers,and picked this as a early Christmas present for myself. While I primarily use it for books. I have used it as a tablet. I would recommend it for anyone."
"Easy to use, good battery time. Would recommend for anyone."
My kids are very pleased with their tablets and i was please with how easy it was to set up and use right away
Love it Cheap and good tablet. Has no memory but it's ok it does what I need it to do and my niece loves it! She's entertained! Would buy more!
"Amazon has a great way of stream-lining their platform, operating system, and design style all within this 1 tablet; great product!"
It's a great product. I recommended to everyone. :-)
"Gave this as a gift, and I have to say, it does everything he wants a tablet to do. Win win!"
Run nice and smooth in long run. Overall great buy.
Love this tablet I got for both my young girls. They love them use them for games and learning games which all seem to be free for the most part.
"The best tablet I have had! Overall its great.Great camera, tools, apps & great battery! That will last."
"I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter, had some issues with the charging cable. Took it in and Best Buy replaced it because I bought the 2 year replacement product. Its nice because I can use a card and she can download whatever games she wants"
This is a great item and one of the best prices you can get. Works well and easy to setup.
"I wanted a cheap e-reader that also had tablet capabilities. I mostly use this to check out and read books from the library, but also do other things like read emails, browse the web, etc. It's a great reasonably priced e-reader/tablet. I recommend it."
"Capacity limit is my only gripe. Connects quickly and easily to wifi and remembers wifi passwords until you erase them. Books, many are free, especially the ones that you never read in High school. Check email, even works with Bluetooth keyboard. Cant be beat at the price."
Love the amazon fire. I definitely recommend this product
"Purchased this is a gift for a 7 year old and 13 year old. They both love the tab. They can play their games, surf the web and most importantly, read books!!! For the price you can't beat this tablet. Well done Amazon."
"I love amazon tablets that I bought them for my daughter, sister, sister in law and mother in law. Awesome product and easy to use."
I bought 2 of these 1 for each of my daughters they have been great so far
"Wonderful Product, do not need a computer any more. Great price too"
We bought on the Black Friday deal and they are great! The 8 is better since it is bigger but they are still great
"It was a Christmas Gift for Mom and Dad. They both love them and use them all the time. Its processor is pretty accurate, but not too slow. I would recommend as a gift."
The tablet is very user friendly for my mom who is not very computer savvy.
I like it I use it for everyone. It's a great tablet
The tablet is very nice and so easy to youse I have it to my mother for Christmas!
I purchased this for my two granddaughters they are 4 and 3 they use it to watch videos while in the car and for travelling..
"This is my second tablet, but first based on android. This is their entry level tablet but still very responsive and snappy. The memory is upgradeable via memory card."
I was impressed with the quality I got for the price. I would recommend this product ti others.
"Got this tablet for my niece and nephew, it is wonderful for children."
"I gave this to my God child, ahe is 6 , she loves it to deaf"
I'm not very tech savvy but we're getting there! I think this is a great price for a tablet that can do so much!
"Great tablet, great price. Perfect gift for your child. My daughter loves it."
Swiping had to be repeated several times sometimes to get the action to respond. Returned.
purchased this to supplement my larger tablet perfect size for smaller bag.
Bought it for my grandson he loves it. He is 5 and he know his way around the kindle better than I do.
This is a great tablet to purchase for kids who are just learning how to use a tablet.
I purchased this tablet for a need family for christmas.I know they really enjoyed it
"Gave as a Christmas gift. Don't know how good it works, or anything about it"
Perfect for emailing and reading books online. Battery lasts a long tine.
I purchased 3 of these for our white elephant games for Christmas. I ended up actually getting one but gave it away to a cousin. He loves it and says it works like a charm. Took him getting some used to on the Android system.
"Its very light weight. Easy to get app installed, and my child has no problem watching her shows."
Very good tablet for the money. A lot fast than I thought it would be. Bought 2 for gifts.
Great tablet to serve as a backup for our primary ipads
"At an awesome price and great tablet! Works like a phone, so easy for smaller kids"
Great little tablet. Bought for my neice to mess around on. Does everything the expensive ones do for a fraction of the cost.
"I bought two and gave them to my nieces , they just enjoyed them the minute they were in their hands . Made them so happy !"
"Great tablet for the price! I bought two of these for my Grandkids to use, as they are always using ours! The only thing that I really don't like about them is that they have so many pop in commercials for grown ups and it makes everything stop. Hard for my little three year old to get this! I wish it were a little more kid friendly as far as ease of use and getting to where you want to be. For the price, I guess we will just deal with it! :)"
My kids love there Fire. They cannot put it down. They love being able to download books and read them right from their tablet.
Got this tablet for my daughter and it has been good for her. Size and weight is just right for her small hands. Only draw back is you can only get apps that amazon has developed. Not able to get android apps on it.
Works great was a gift for daughter she loves it!!
I loved that the kids enjoyed it and I would be getting another one
For the price this tablet can't be beat. My wife mostly uses it 4 reading and Amazon shopping. It does everything she needs it to do. Battery life is very good as well.
I bought this for my grandson and he loved it and it easy for him to handle without help
This is a nice simple tablet for the price. Good enough for basics. The graphics are better than I expected.
This is a great tablet for ages 5 and up. My son can watch videos play games. Its perfect for him.
Great for web browsing..shopping online..reading books and magazines or watching movies and you can't beat the price!!
One of my many Christmas gifts and it was successful
Perfect tablet for my 4 yr old grandson. Easy to use.
Sturdy and easy to use. Not bad for teenagers to use
Extremely durable and user friendly very satisfied with this product
"I already have a Kindle, and a tablet, but I wanted something smaller to take when traveling to download movies to. This is perfect! Good price, and the color and clarity is perfect!"
"I LOVE HOW AMAZON HAS ""CHILD ONLY APPS"". SHE CON ONLY ACCESS AGE APPROPRIATE MATERIAL"
Only regret not buying the larger one but I don't read alot at a time so it will work just fine
Great tablet for my nephew he watches his videos on it all the time
Great tablet for the price my kids love it I brought 3 more why not.
I love the Amazon Fire 7! It's very easy to use and I love the fact that you can turn the Blue Shade lighting on and off. It's fabulous for reading before bed.
"Price was great, tablet not the fastest but easily works with my echo and Amazon Prime."
"Great price for a tablet I got two of them one for each if my children ranging from 7 and 8 years old only down part I can think of is the charging port going bad, It's super ooose and hard to charge."
I purchased it for my dad and he has had no complaints. He's able to download all the games easily and fast.
We got a pair of kindles for our daughters. They love everything they can do with them. My wife and I are now able to use our iPads.
I purchased two of these for my grandchildren 8 years and 2 years. The 8 yr. old wanted an IPod touch replacement to watch videos and play a few games and Skype with me for $35 vs. $300 I am very pleased. The 2 yr old watches Little Einsteins and this works great for her
I bought two of this at Christmas. Great for everyone in the family.
Easy to use. Friendly to the beginner user. Decent camera.
"Works great, easy to use. Battery holds charge good. Just the right size."
The tablet I bought was not what I expected and I wanted to return.
Nice tablet for the price. Comes linked to amazon account
Bought the two tablets for two of my younger grandkids. So far the tablets have held up well. My daughter likes having the ability to limit what the kids can use the tablets for.
i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
overall good but does not find 5ghz networks which is why i returned it.
Got the tablet for my grandma. She was able to figure it out and she doesn't even have a mobile phone. Not bad for under $40.
Does everything you want a pad to do the price was the purchase point for me.. Easy set up
Not the greatest for productivity but it's very good at entertaining kids at a cheap price.
I can't get my tablet to set the time so I haven't been able to even use it a little disappointed with this purchase no instructions came with it!!
"I bought it for my mom and it is perfect. It recharges quickly and was very cheap and effective. Nothing fancy but sturdy and gets the job done, like the San Antonio spurs."
Sometimes the screen is not as responsive as I would like it to be but it does what we need it to do and our daughter loves it.
It was for my niece she absolutely loves pink. And has been playing it since I gave it to her
Stopped working after only a year. Felt flimsy. Did like that I could upload Amazon books
Git this tablet for my daughter. She is loving it!
I bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it!
The quality is great with an affordable price my kids love this product!!!!!!!!!!!
"purchased this for grandson, great price easy out of the box. awesome price had some leftover for a case an essential part for a 7 year old :)"
Great tablet great quality i liked and for the price its great
"I was looking for a simple tablet, to be able to play a few games, read e-books, and such. It's not as fast or sophisticated as an iphone, or ipad, but it's simple to use and nice to read a book, or several on. I'd recommend for budget-minded users, who don't mind being tethered to wifi."
"For the cost of the tablet, I am very pleased. It is much easier to use this for Kindle vs. reading off of my phone!"
"Christmas present for the kids, its strong and durable and constantly used. inexpensive as is unless you want to get the kid proof case.Apps, games, web browsing and video/photo functions are good. Do think how this item will be used as most likely its internal storage at 16gb will fill up quickly"
works great once I figured it out. Books are easy to download.
I bought this item for my preteen granddaughter. She enjoys reading and learning apps. This device travels well and is easy to use.
Bought this for my nephew for christmas who has been asking for a tablet. It was on sale for an outrageous deal and couldn't pass up. Works fine and he love it. would recomend
"Good product for the beginner in the tablet arena without spending a fortune, or paying for a name you don't know.."
"The tablet is great! Easy to use, better than the Galaxy that I have."
Tablet is durable and easy to work with. My son takes it every where.
I was searching for a tablet that would be great for reading books and downloading games. This kindle is the right size for a tablet. Works great!
Broughtt it for a chistmas gift. No complaints yet.
Gift for the wife. She rea!ly likes it and uses it a lot.
I purchased this tablet when it was on sale for black Friday. Overall it works great. Can't beat the price.
"does everything i need plenty of apps to download along with books and movies, with Prime, great bonus"
I'm really happy with my Kindle Fire! It's easy to use and has so many features…don't know why I waited so long to get one :)
Better cost effective tablet for basic usage of browsing
"for 50 bucks you will not get a better tablet. I've been waiting to buy a fire, not sure why I waited so long!"
"Life battery very good , search engine very good.very fast."
I love this item because I just love all electronics
"The tablet exceeds the price expectations. Great for reading books, ok for browsing. The time warner cable tv app works well with this device."
Right out of the box it was great and have had no issues to date.
Awesome tablet. Good for reading and portable to bring all around.
Works good for a cheap tablet to have around work and not worry about. Freezes occasionally but not a big deal for the cost.
Good product and good price. Have enjoyed it since Christmas and cant wait to read on it every evening
Bought this black Friday for 34 bucks. Cheap but reliable and nice. I would recommend this to everybody. It's fast and nice looking
"I bought 3 of these tablets. One for my dad, son and grandson and they all love it! My dad who is 76 years old and not computer lit at all said it is ""pretty easy"" to use (after it was set up by my son for him)."
"I bought this for my husband to replace his original Kindle. The lighted background and light weight makes it perfect for reading in bed. The added features of Internet and numerous apps make it perfect for so many uses. It is easy to manage and the grandkids also love using it for the games. It has a great camera, too! Overall very pleased."
I purchased two of these for my grandchildren. They love them!
"Great tablet for all ages, easy to navigate, charges fast. Great resolution"
Great tablet for a 4 year old to put learning games on
Love the size and it capabilities! Was a great gift for my daughter!
I wanted to find a tablet to give to my grandkids. Being able to spend 37.50 on Thanksgiving made this a no brainier for a tablet to give them. I was able to purchase 3 and they are really enjoying it. It may not be top of the line but it works great for them.
Bought this for my daughter. Tablet works amazing. Only thing I didnt like was that you are REQUIRED to place a CC on file with amazon in order to use it.I would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy models vs others.
It's a great tablet for my kids at their age. I recommend it to anybody looking for one.
We bought this tablet for our 6-year old. It has a lot of kid-friendly features and my daughter loves it.
this product is very nice and its nice to review. Its also very nice.
Seems to be sturdy and lite weight for small hands
"A decent machine for the Black Friday price of under $40. The 8 GB of memory is inadequate if you play games using the Apps. I added a 32 GB micro SD card, but not all the Apps use it and the ones that do, only transfer part of the application to it. All points, coins, etc earned are retained in internal memory, not SD card. Pictures, videos, music can be stored on SD card. Screen is very sharp."
Just the right size for travel and resolution is amazing.
"Got this for my father in law who loves to play games and read books, news."
Purchased for a child. Works great Very pleased. Very versatile
"We purchased this for our 5 & 4 yr olds. It is something to help with learning to read and write.The big downfall is that even the ""free"" apps require you to purchase add-ons to unlock more of the app."
"Good for kids ... brightness is not so good, ....."
"I love the kindle fire. I have an I pad but I love to read on my kindle. The size is great, I like to read at night so my kindle makes it much easier. My grandson also plays games on it. It is a great product."
"It probably does just as much as more expensive tablets and it's easy to use. The 7"" screen is a bit small but does make it easier to take anywhere."
"The Kindle Fire is nice, sleek, and well functional. I bought this as a Christmas gift, which was a real success. It has all you need; your downloadable books, games, and web access. It immediately updates to the latest version once you install your internet code."
"Really nice tablet/kindle for the price. It's good for travel and packs small. It's nice to have a ""tv"", ""book"", and the internet all in one."
bought for my grand daughter and she loves it. She likes to read and this is great for that
For the price she got a nice tablet tha she can use for games pics and videos
Unfortunately I've been using a far superior tablet when I decided to purchase the Amazon Fire tablet. Comparisons are unavoidable. The Amazon Fire works. Amazon only apps are not as numerous as Google. The tablet is not as streamlined as my other tablet.
"I like the kindle fire for all the free games you can get on it. I wanted it for a long time and during the holiday season, I found it on sale and I bought it!"
"Made my sisters sons Christmas! Priced right and as expected a very solid performing tablet, thanks again Best Buy!"
I bought this on Black Friday for my 9 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it
paid 39.00 on sale. bought two and 1 week later one will not connect to wifi will have to return.
"Its a good tablet, screen is kind of weird but it does its job. I wish the it had more memory but for the price, I can't expect to much for a inexpensive tablet. But what I do love is that all the apps are free so that's a #SCORE. Great for kids"
Price for the device was a great deal and the assistance provided by employees was great.
this was perfect for when the grandchildren are over. we have ten from age 2 thru 13 and they all love it. i even enjoy using it
"I bought this for a gift but kept it for my self. It has basic functioanality, but easy to use. This definitely not for those expecting a powerhouse tablet, but for a child it is great!"
First kindle. Only used a few things. It was easy to set up. Now to purchase another for my daughter and see how easy to link.
This is a good value but I purchased a Kindle Fire Black Friday of 2015 and I have to say it has more features and now I am spoiled. It is a 16 gb storage also. I want another one like it in case mine ever quits.
"Have enjoyed this kindle, especially for the price."
Perfect for my child. Only issue I have with it is the advertisements that pop up when you turn it on.
"Christmas present for a 4 year old. Showed her once how to turn it on, how to charge and how to get to the various apps. She is totally capable of operating the device on her own. So easy breezy a 4 year old can use it independently."
I really like this tablet because of the awesome resolution.
Just a great product and the price is very competable
This tablet is perfect for kids. It is inexpensive and durable.
This was bought for a first time user of any type of computer/tablet. He found it very easy to work with and enjoys it very much
Love this tablet for my kids! Great price and fits my 6 year old twins needs.
I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet. Although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well.
"Great gifts for grandchildren.. At the per unit price, I'm grandpa of the year."
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He was thrilled to receive it and hasn't put it down. I'm also glad it came with a power cord.
Nice size and easy to use and handy to take along with you.
Really nice and easy to use.It's my first tablet and I love it.
"It wouldn't connect to internet. Tried at home, at a couple of Wi-Fi spots and at the store where I bought it."
Bought for our son as a first tablet. He loves it and connects easily to our home wireless.
"The price on this is great. There are a couple of issues I have with my Kindle but I think it's me not the device. Sometimes when I shut it off I have to hold down the power button as the box that comes up that says ok or cancel does not work for me. The other problem I have is sometimes it does not go back to where I left off in a book. I took it to the store and the tech I had look at it did not have these problems. Other that that I love it. I can travel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email, movies and books. I purchased a case for it that sets it up so I don't have to hold it and that made me like it even more."
A great place to start in tablet market good value
I love the price of this product. And for the price it gives you Big Bang for the buck. My wife does not use electronics and she has no problem using this.
"Haven't used it much, but so far I like it! Mostly use to play games on."
"Great for web surfing. Easy to learn, easy to master."
"Bought this tablet as a gift and so far they are happy with it. I did the set up and I can tell you it didnt lag or freeze so thats always a plus. It runs on the amazon app store. I dont care for it cause it dont have as many apps as others. Other than that and the low memory, I like it. Personally I download alot of game apps so i need lots of memeory but for my mother in law its just fine. She likes to read books on it, she says its good for that. Also she was able to get the libraries app and download free books so thats a plus."
Pretty slow if you're trying to use it as a full-time tablet. Good as an eReader and sometimes game and Internet usage.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 12 year old niece. She loves it. She is consistently checking her facebook and playing games from all the apps. SHe a loves it.
Bought for my grandma and she loves it. Very easy and simple to use.
"I currently own 3 Kindles, including this one, so I am very familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets. I love that this new Fire has updated the look and feel. I can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so I can take them with me when I'm on the go and don't picture, which I love! So for $50, it's a great value. There are only 2 things that I wish this Kindle had: there is no sleep/wake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my TV, but again, for the price it's a great product."
"Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!"
I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire but would have liked a bigger screen model. Good for playing games.
"Kindle is good. I got one for my husband and sister. They are really enjoying them. It is easy to use for someone who never used one. My reason for not giving 5 stars was completely due to my best buy experience. I live in a small town and drove thirty miles to get to best buy only to find they were completely out. Asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.I wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.I was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them. They would not do that. I had to drive another 50 miles to pick one up. Just thought best buy should have tried to be more accommodating, but it was Christmas shopping season."
"Bought 2 of these on sale for my grandkids. They love them & they seem to work good. One tablet goes to school the other, if it lasts until next school year, will be going to school also. Good tablet for the money."
"The Amazon Fire pad is a great deal for the price. It works great very responsive, does exactly what I want it to do like Netflix, Google and a few games. It doesn't suck :)"
Great little tablet would have got Five stars if you could use it with chromcast
All is well. Haven't heard any complaints. Hopefully he will use it to help with his school work and not just play games with it.
I haven't had one in years and happy for the newer version.
I bought it for my nephew and he loves it is just perfect for works better then his hp tablet.
"Great value for the price, recipient is enjoying it very much!"
It is a good tablet for the price and for young children.
I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she loved it.
Bought this tablet for our 6 year old son for Christmas to play games and take pictures along with a unicorn beetle defender case and it has totally exceeded our expectations! Totally worth the little bit of money you spend!
Best Christmas Gift ever to my Mom that doesn't use a computer
Bought this for my 9 year old. It's perfect to keep on hand to keep her occupied if we get caught waiting somewhere.
I am pleased that it has all the apps she needs on it
"Easy to set up and easy to use. My only complaint is that even with the 32g scan card, it fills up quickly."
"Husband lost first kindle fire right before Christmas, so Santa brought him this one as a replacement. He's happy! Seems to work the same as earlier model."
The tablet is mainly used by my 9 year old daughter .... Easy to use!
My husband is enjoying this tablet for reading and netflix.
I found this tablet to be very easy to use and really liked the dual camera it has
"I bought it as a gift for my grandfather, from what I can tell he really seems to enjoy it."
"This tablet is a great buy. It does many things and keeps my kids happy. I'm very pleased, we have 2 of them."
"I bought it for x-mas for my 6 years old boy and he loves it. Great quality and AWESOME price, you cannot beat that !!!He uses it for Netflix, games and school..."
"Affordable, and it gets the job done. Not the most cutting-edge device, but nice nonetheless."
My son really enjoys this tablet. It's easy to navigate
It's an alright tablet for my parents to learn and use for Skype
My grandson loves it. He said his games don't freeze up on this one.
"Amazon Fire is perfect for families on the go! It fits well into backpacks, purses and briefcases!"
I got it for my god son and he loves it .it's east use to
"This tablet is simple and easy to use. The only problem I've had is putting in a memory card. The tablet kept pushing it back out, had to read reviews online in order to input it properly."
Too many advertisements to get through. A little tough to adjust to coming from the apple world.
Price great for quality and versatility. Bought for son to use for streaming movies and reading books. Great product for him but had to purchase extended memory miniSd card.
Great tablet works very good and the price is cheap.
Keeps my kids busy while I cook & when in the car.
Kept my kids busy on road trip & while I cook daily
Decent tablet for the price. Expect just basic use and function. This is no iPad be sure you aren't expecting that.
"After opening several gifts on Christmas, my 8 year old grandson kept going back to this gift and playing with it. He was very pleased. He loves his Kindle Fire and plays games and does his homework with it too!"
Best tablet and most affortable. Love that it just works. Must have Prime.
I purchased this item for my 10 year old son and he loves it. He is able to download books and any kind of games that he likes.
The Amazon Fire offers the same access to online resources as the much more expensive IPad and functions just as well.
Bad performance. Slow device. Not worth buying. Better products are available in this range.
"We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)"
Purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. She loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. She loves the device and the pink color; I loved the price and the fast delivery .
This tablet for ~$35 is an amazing deal. It's almost a no-brainer to get one for any long family trip.
I bought this for my four year old nephew. He is enjoying it.
tablet was easy to set up and get started. 80 year old mother loves it!
"BOUGHT ON BLACK FRIDAY FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE THOUGHT I PAID 100.00 MORE FOR IT. IT DOES A LOT. SHE LOVES IT."
"I love every thing about the product and transaction, no complaints at all. I love that its affordable and does about every thing you would have need of."
"Since today society is hi-tech savvy, it was only right to get this for my 4 yr old grandson. It's an awesome tablet!"
"We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!"
I love the kindle. My kids love playing their Disney movies on it. They also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. I highly recommend!
"There is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. It is not up to par with Apple pads and the high end Samsung pads. Check out the Amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. The screen is adequate, not HD, and outside/full sun hard to read. The operating system is Amazon's version of Android. Audio is adequate. WiFi and Bluetooth work well."
The tablet is easy to set up and easy to use. Great tablet for family use.
"My daughter always want one, she got this one, she love it."
I was worried at first since it was cheap but I'm loving it more and more everyday. In fact I went out and bought another for a Christmas gift for a family member. Easy gift. And you can use HBO go and Netflix. The only negative is there was no blue tooth. Just a FYI it's the 5th gen 8g amazon fire
"This gift was a stocking stuffer. For the price, I paid, wonderful. The recipient loved it! :)"
"Had one of these 2 years ago, got this one on sale and I usually pay more for a dinner. Does everything you need and plus you can expand the memory."
The product was overall worth the money spent. Love it !!!
"I love the color is choose,and the tablet is great"
"I have had this product for about a year now, and I am still very pleased with my purchase. I am able to read books, surf the web, listen to music, watch videos, and more. Unbelievable price for everything you can do on this tablet."
My daughter loves it and you can't beat the warranty!
I brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.
"To me, this is an AMAZING little device. I suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. Downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable--my home internet connection is not the greatest. But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook. The graphic on games amaze me. If you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, I think this is a great choice. I'm considering getting one for my sister."
"This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!"
"It's just what I was looking for, something simple and inexpensive. Plus I got it for $35 on black friday."
"Purchased this for my grandson. He loves it, especially the front/rear camera."
Great tablet and perfect for the kids. I will be going back to buy more of these at this price!
I love that even great quality product like this is available to masses who can actually afford them. The table does it job really good. And i'm happy with my purchase.
"Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance."
"I bought this because of the low price on Black Friday. My aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original Kindle. And, I have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. Thrilled I bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. The light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me."
This is a great product . I bought it for my grandsons 12th birthday. It was super easy for him to monuva. He loves it
"Clunky and full of ads. Ok for my kids to use for games, but I wouldn't use this for myself."
Love it very much thanks. I use my table for banking
This is the second Fire tablet for $35 that I purchased this season. They are a great value and Best Buy has been a great place to buy them
"1st tablet,easy to use and set up.plenty of apps preloaded to start."
For the price tag of $59 bucks u can't go wrong....
Bought this for myself at Christmas as a replacement for my older version. This one has clearer graphics but I find the build to be way cheaper and definitely a great deal thinner..felt to flimsy to me.
I bought this as a Christmas gift and my sister loves it! Great price on Black Friday as well!
i bought this for someone for a gift for xmas. this is a good simple tablet for someone to being with.
Bery good product for the price. Can't beat it. Id recommend buying this for a first time tablet.
It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.
"I purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap. I'm not impressed with anything about it. It is slow, not at all user friendly, and the advertising is so very annoying. It is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps I use on a regular basis. I will keep it only to access my amazon accounts."
I bought two and gave them as gifts to a couple new to tablets. They love the FIRE tablet. now I think I am going to get one to play my games on. I currently have the iPad air.
"Looking for a desent product , best buy had black Friday tablets for $34.99, what a great bargain. I had to buy four of them for my grandkids. Just the look on thier faces when they opened, was a great joy for me."
Compact. Easy to hold Great for playing games. Easy to use keyboard
This is a great tablet for the right price. I bought two of these tablets as gifts to my sons. They were pleased.
I bought the tablet black Friday. Best buy had the same price as amazon. So I got it. The tablet was a gift for someone else. the recipient to this day insists that I should have gotten one for myself.
This tablet is a perfect size and very sturdy. Has an expandable memory slot. Perfect for my needs.
Great tablet and excellent for kids also. I have been recommending to everyone
Amazing device. I got it for 35 bucks on Black Friday. Plays all games the kids want. Snappy and fast. Great for kids and adults. Love the Amazon kindle.
The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.
Good tablet for traveling and reading on the road.
It has a multiple futures for kids and parental control that you can setup for your kids. Even you can control usage of tablet for your kids
Great tablet for a beginner to get used to the technology
"My son is not gentle and has managed to destroy a few other, more expensive, tablets. I bought this for a fraction of what the other tablets cost and it works great. He loves it."
Amazing price and awesome for a tablet for children. My 6 & 13 year old nieces love them
I bought this for my youngest to read and play. Awesome!
"Wow. I've had many tablets, but none come close to this for the price. The screen is clear and responsive. While it comes locked to amazon, i sideloaded the nook app without root, and then rooted it easily, just for fun. XDA has the details."
"Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!"
"Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras."
Was easy to set up and very easy to use. For a basic tablet I would recommend it.
Much better than I expected for the very reasonable price.
Very nice product...Had everything we were looking for...
"I've had the old 6"" HD Amazon tablet which I use with the students at the school where I teach. Got this 7"" tablet on my first day at this job to keep at home and use. The larger real estate of this tablet is fantastic...along with the new version of the OS."
Great price and product. i bought 2 for my nieces. This is very practical and does the same as the more expensive one's.
"If you want the combination of a kindle for reading as well as some of the features of a tablet, this is an excellent value for the price. I like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book I am reading and my email or other web uses.It seems like the battery discharges rather quickly compared to my other kindle. I often keep this one plugged in while I am using it."
I am impressed with the quality of the Amazon Fire for the price
it very easy to work and does very good good games my child loves it he not but 4 and finds his way around on it
"For $50 you cant go wrong, there are other no name brands that cost more that are worst. Didn't need to put much thought into buying one. Great christmas gift for anyone of all age groups."
I bought it for my mom and she loves it. Great picture and great battery life.
"I'm not very familiar with tablets, so didn't know what to expect, but it does what I wanted it to do."
"The kindle fire has all the things you need to read books, surf the net and play!"
I got this Kindle as a Christmas gift for a friend. Couldn't pass up the Black Friday price on this thing! Works great. She loves it. Success!
"This is a Great little unit for the price! Pretty quick with the four processors, good apps as well. Very pleased!"
apps constantly fail to open. no flash for camera. hard to download anything not amazon ie: google apps. will be returning....
this tablet works great for note taking at school.
Purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it. Ended up buying another after a day of using the device.Pros:- Fast boot time- Clear & sharp display- Long battery life- Light weightCons:- Adds on lock screen- Inability to remove apps from the home screen (Can only move them to a folder)- Screen shows more fingerprints then say an Ipad or Nexus deviceOverall this has been a great device and hasnt had any issues. I play Game of War on the device and watch Hulu/Netflix for the majority of my use. For an Ebook is it smaller but does the job.
I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.
A very good tablet with a lot of features for a very reasonable price.
STILL IN SHOCK ALL THE TABLET CAN DO FOR $50!ITS A NO BRAINER
Nice size easy to use for little people. Long lasting battery
"Great little tablet, good price and charge lasts for at least about 6 hours or longer."
My grandson loves his tablet. He recently lost his (we are not sure where) and was so happy to see the new one
Works as described very portable with wifi and Bluetooth
I bought this for my grandson and he likes it a lot He is only 5 years old and it is perfect size for him He wanted a red one but likes the blue.We put abc mouse on it and he is able to find it for himself. Great price
"The Charger is not lasting, Screen is ok,Functionality good. size to small but for the price is ok.Worst thing is the charger and battery life."
Birthday gift for wife. Her other tablet battery only lasts a hour. She wanted another one. Great tablet for the price.
Easy to read books. Great for night reading. Easy to download books
"I came across this on sale and couldn't pass it up. Turns out it runs slower than I expected though. My girlfriend has an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one. Still, a nice alternative for browsing/shopping/bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery."
"Great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging. It comes pre loaded with loads of apps and has a nice feel in the hands. screen quality is nice, the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it takes the kindle to start up and shut down, it can get annoying at times. i have a 2 yo and 8yo and its held up great, dropped on cement and no cracks."
This item is great got for my sister as a birthday gift. She uses it for reading and music
Great product at a great price. Gave out as Safety recognition gifts.
"Bought the Kindle for xmas gift,the young lady really loves it she reads books on it."
I bought this for my daughter during the holidays and after four months of use it would no longer would charge. I tried other charges as well and it's definitely the tablet. Now I have to go through the hassle of seeing if I can still replace it under warranty.
"This is our family's 3rd fire tablet, great, affordable solution for our family"
excellent value for the price. Tablet works well for my 9 year old!
Goog!I would recommend this to a friend!!!I like it
"Please don't let the cheap price of this tablet fool you. I can do a lot with it: surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games, etc. There's an issue with the volume of Amazon Fire 7 (not quite loud enough for me even when I turn the volume to its max). But I think I still did a great decision to buy it. Good product overall."
Good tablet for general use. Easy to add apps. Good battery lifetime.
"I love my Amazon Fire, it's easy to download books, fun to read and I use it to catch up on my Facebook and email accounts."
My tablet works very well purchased.one for a friend she brought a sd card for more storage space having problems with it tells her not enough storage space
Works great! Purchased as holiday gift for 80 year old grandmother.
The young girl and boy that I bought the units for in Nigeria for school use just love them the price was great and they are being put to good use.
meets or exceeds all my needs simple and fun for games. looking forward to reading my first book
I wish it were a little bit bigger but it's just right for what I need. It's light weight and compact. Very easy to use and priced very reasonably!
It works great for what I need. Not a fan of ads and that it sends e-mails of all the apps I download. But I just use it for a few apps.
"I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot. This version of the Fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.The new OS seems to work well in spite of the ""commercial"" aspect. After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable. This feature was not a surprise but what I would expect in a device from Amazon and its ecosystem.The Kindle Fire is an excellent 7-inch tablet for its $50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby."
Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.
Great tablet for a beginner to catch up on reading.
great price and great birthday gift for my son.no complaints so far. my son & his sister enjoy playing games and watching videos.
I liked this product and its very good for daily use.
we bought this for my 11 year old daughter and we love it. So easy to set up and use. Much better than the one made especially for kids. This one has better capabilities.
I've purchased Kindle Fire in the past for our girls and they loved them (literally) to pieces. They lasted 2 years before cracked screens meant replacement was necessary. These new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement was easy! They work great and the girls are happy.
"I had to buy this Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black, as the price was right.What a great device. I did not expect it to perform the way it has. I have streamed video, read books and installed a 64GB sdcard i had laying around. Great for travel, due to the price I really have not lost anything if it is lost or damaged."
"Giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier!! Great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!"
"This Amazon Fire tablet is AMAZING. It's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. You get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. The screen is surprisingly well made and durable. While it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. There is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. The speaker gets to a decent volume, but I would not consider it to be loud. I took a leap of faith here in buying this and I am so very glad that I did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. The games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what I've seen so far. This plays demanding 3d games pretty well I may add. The Amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. It only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. The micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. Battery life is ok. If not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. With light use, this could last all day on a single charge. Video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. The responsiveness of the screen is spot on. I can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. The one thing I will say could be better it the wifi. When set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. Once I set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. You usually get what you pay for. In this case, you get more. This unit feels like it could have easily cost well over $100. I'm just sad that I didn't yet get a protective case for mine. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. This Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. I'm picky too. If you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. You won't be disappointed."
"Great features and for an excellent price. I bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. It allows me to control what features he can use, Apps, books, videos, etc. He used an Android one (my wife's) before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used."
For having a discount for this price it was a deal i couldn't pass up. Even when everywhere seems to be sold out of this item i was still able to find best buy mobile had them in stock. Makes a great stocking stuff.
This tablet is very easy to use and a perfect size.
Great value for the price grabbed 2 of these for the kiddos. They are capable of playing games and with the know how you can put Google play store on them.
This tablet was purchased for a gift given to a friend with no prior experience using a tablet. The tutorial given in the beginning made it simple to understand.
Great product. It was on sale and I didn't think it was going to be great but it was
Seems smaller than the older version but it still does the job. User friendly.
Got them as birthday presents for my grandsons and love them
Very pleased with the tablet. This is our fourth one we have owned.
"I love the ability to pick and choose magazines, books and more at my leisure. Also love being a prime member and getting a free new book each month as well as 1000s of other selections from Kindle Unlimited! LOVE!"
"Great little tablet, fast, does a lot but does not do it all. Missing Google Play Store and screen is only ok. Price cannot be beaten"
"I'm a proud owner of 2 kindles and 3 kindle fires, my entire family loves them. I love how child friendly they are."
.great for small children.. Easy to set up and use
I purchased it to read books and I love the fact that I can play games on it also. Works fine and is easy to use and for the price I do not think you can go wrong.
I think this tablet is very easy to use. It is price well.
How can you complain about anything this food for this cheap?
"great for the price, did research and found this #"
"I 'm very please with the tablet haven't had any problem. It does everything I need it to do. I would recomend it.,"
Bought for friend so could have face time with grandbaby.
I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift. It is a great tablet for a great price!
My 6 year old got one last year and it's very good
Best Tablet under $50. It works great with a perfect size to hold in hand. Great deal.
Works good for price. My kid likes it very much. Good value for money
I have the happiest grandson ever. Which makes me the best grandma ever!!
"For $50 this table was a no brainer. It's fantastic. Light, good battery life and I get the apps that I want/need.I am not a fan of the Silk browser, but I didn't buy this to surf. I bought it to read books and watch Netflix. It works perfectly for that. It's so good, I bought 2."
I have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am I glad I did. Tablet runs faster than I thought and has a very good display. If you can't afford an Ipad get this!
"First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung."
The tablet has good versatility and is an excellent device for young children.
have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black Friday for 34.99. got 2 more.
The tablet exceeded my expectations for $35. Kids love to play games on it and is great for social media.
"Bought this during the black friday sale for $35 and can't complain at all. Keeps my kids busy, and runs hearthstone, that's all I need."
"We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great. We can really only run the internet and Facebook on this device. Will be returning and getting a different tablet."
"This is the third one in our house. It's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails"
I bought two of these as gifts for Christmas. One for my mom and one for a 9 yr. old. I'm a tech geek so I think these are great to introduce to and older parent or small kid just because of the price alone (Not for us tech guru's). I got them on black Friday for $34.99. Great e reader and awesome for games like candy crush. Only downside is the 8gb but for $34.99 that's not even an issue!
My wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy I'm happy!!!
So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:
"For the price that I paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. It does exactly what i bought ir for"
Good product great price.best buy rep was good help
My kids love them and they have yet to break them! Unlike some others I've tried that cost twice as much.
Love my Kindle fire so easy to use and amazon customer service is amazing
I love this item...I got it for my grand daughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it also...this is her first tablet and it has all the features she'll love!!
Bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas she is going to love it I've already downloaded a bunch of book and apps for her so it will be all set for Christmas morning
"For the price that I paid, 35 dollars, it is more than enough. the best is the front and rear camera."
Wanted inexpensive tablet for my grandkids and these did the job.Cheers!
Love the great deal on this tablet. Black friday deal
"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. I set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. Free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. School websites dont work. Wish I had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase."
"What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made."
Bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good!
This is perfect for my 2 year old. I love the option for 2 accounts...the kid account is very streamline.
"Size is perfect for little hands, Great features and excellent reviews. Great amount of space needed for use."
For the features and the price i got it for on black Friday I can't complain.
Camera a little lower quality and cpu speed a little slower than fire HD but a good price
so far it has been working really well especially for the one's it was bought for. It's their first time using one and everything seems to work well. It takes real nice picture's and is very durable.
I love that I can have the convenience of my laptop and my games in a small tablet.
The weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling
"Bought this as part of the Black Friday sale. For $40, it serves well as a light use tablet (Skype, e-mail, video, etc.). The ads and heavy Amazon product front load push are annoying. Can't change or hide any preloaded features. Can't complain much for the price and the fact that I won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced."
"I bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. Also bought a screen shield & a 'kid proof' case. However, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. At least it was only $50 :/My nephew has an 1st gen iPad Air, w a kid case; he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. You get what you pay for."
The Whispersync technology that allows a child to read a book and listen to the audio book while it highlights the words is an indispensable tool for young readers.
"I have really enjoyed this device. It works very well. Only thing I was disappointed with was that when I bought it the cashier at Best Buy said if I found it cheaper in another store, or online that would give me the difference in the money. I did find it cheaper online but the manager refused to give me the difference of $15. I suggested they not tell customers they would honor a cheaper price when they won't really do it."
"Bought this as a gift as I was on a budget, I figured it would be okay but I got say it is actually faster than my iPad Air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps"
"If you want a tablet to perform basic functions, you can't do any better than the Kindle Fire 7. Check email, social media, surf the web, download and read ebooks with no problems. Good battery life."
I got this as gifts for my kids and other family then even myself. I wish I would have got this tablet along time ago.
"Overall this seems to be a good tablet, but I wish it used the Google Play store as well as the Amazon apps, because I can't get the Target Cartwheel without paying."
Allows my teens to access apps and Internet while still reading on down time between games
I got this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old son and he absolutely loves it. It is very user friendly and I love the parental controls.
It was a great gift to give for some one who can not afford a tablet.
This is an amazing tablet for the price! I bought 4 at Christmas for the grands and one for me!
I use this mostly as an e-reader but it is also great for web browsing and e-mail. I didn' t expect such good performance for the price but I have no complaints.
"I bought three of these tablets. One for each of my boys. They are 5, 6, and seven years old and I have to tell Them to put these down. They would play with them all day if they could"
We bought these a Christmas for our 3 children they have been a great present the kids really enjoy them
"For the low cost what's not to like. Be careful what/how much you load into the limited memory. An excellent entertainment tool especially when powered with PRIME. Screen (movies & Tv) display excellent. I recommend a ""glass"" screen protector. Helps greatly manage finger smudge. EZ to setup. EZ to use. EZ on your wallet."
I bought this tablet to replace my daughters Nook. She loves it. It's great for on the go.
This is fast and good size for the kids no fit the big ones but still a good option
Good tablet for the price and for the kids to use. Can do a lot of the things they like and they can use it for school
I bought three of these units. On sale for $34 apiece. Great deal. Great price
Bought for my children. The love their tablets and the price was right
"Picked this up for a 7 year old. I'm used to using iPads, but not a bad little tablet for a kid and Im not worried if if something happens to it."
"Wonderful, so glad I got it. Great for reading. Child restrictions are a plus."
Very nice tablet for the price. Built in storage is limited but easily expandable with a microSD card. The Freetime app for kids is excellent. Overall I would recommend this tablet.
Have now had for a month and I have to say the speed of this tablet is good. Really no lag on browsing. Only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. But for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.
We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones
"I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air."
kids love it...only issue that bothered me is that my reduced price came with ads that in order to be removed i had to pay money. other than that good product
Got it on Black Friday sale and it works pretty good. Nice Hd quality and ease of use.
Tablet is Worth for the Price. It is really fast in response.
"OK for a entry level tablet, great screen for watching movies good HD images."
Love this! Very easy for child or adult to use. Great price too
Easy to understand and good quality of colors on display .
Excellent Quality and Size for my 5 yera old daughterWorks Great 100% Satisfied
Great device don't much like the mandatory advertising
I currently own an Amazon Fire Kindle. My kids love this one. It's the perfect size for them.
"Performance of the device is good, meets expectations."
Bought it as a gift for my brother. He loves it and has no complaints
"Got it on Black Friday and it's a great little tablet for the regular price, let alone the discounted BF deal."
Does everything you need a tablet to do in a small package. I gave it as a gift and the recipient can't put it down. I have the first generation Kindle Fire and I still love it!
"Works ok, doesn't shutdown properly. Notified Amazon tried to fix over the phone. They wanted to replace it but I said I would put up with a ""hard"" shutdown"
"I purchased 2 of these for my 4 & 5 year old grandsons as a Christmas present. They loved them! Easy to use, great screens & volume!"
"Gave this as a gift to my husband. He likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. He's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. That's frustrating."
Perfect little tablet for my son for Christmas. The price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. In addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. He's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!
The Kindle Fire is great for those that are looking for a tablet to use with WiFi and is even better for those that have Amazon Prime. Makes watching your favorite shows and listening to music very easy. Magazines look great as well.
Tablet work like charm and I never have issues with it
Gir two for my sisters well worth the $50. Simple present for anyone
You can't beat the Fire tablets for the price. Can't tell much of difference with non Hd screen. Highly recommend
We can do many things with this Fire. All best entertainment that our family can have from it. Amazon products is better and better day by day!!! Keep it up like that.
This tablet was brought for my 6 year old an is great for just about everything an I love that I can put controls on it . An it was cheap
My daughter loves this tablet. We purchased it for her for Christmas. I found a great bumper case on Amazon and very cheap. This was an awesome deal!
My order was sent to quickly and had precisely what I asked. I will order by these means in the future.
"No complaints here, especially for the price. Good for children or elderly."
We got this for the kids grandmother to keep her occupied and it's doing a great job at it! She has NO complaints and enjoys it
Easy to use and setup. Good features and apps are easy to download.
This tablet is great for entertainment purposes especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. Easy to use and access to most entertainment apps make this tablet and easy purchase especially if you get it on sale for less than $50. Great buy!
My daughter loves this. It isn't an ipad but it does all that a good tablet should do with ease.
Great tablet for simple surfing and reading. Serves it purpose!!
Got these as Christmas presents for some of my family members and I must say they love it.
"I was looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that I could use it to read musical charts off of when I perform and this little tablet has been a great solution for me. The screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. It seems built fairly well and for 39$, I'm happy."
"My nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works"
"Bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. Both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. Price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. Plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids."
easy to use. looks good. The prize winner was very pleased.
"I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!"
This tablet is a good started tablet for children.
Very simple setup and a great little item for the price.
"I think this is a great product/ solution, especially for the price. I needed to replace my portable DVD player. I have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. After looking at my options I decided on getting them both a Kindle for about the same price of 1 DVD player. HEADS UP: The Disney Anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. You have to access it through Amazon movies in order to download them. I got a MicroSD card to store the movies on and so far so good! They held up, supplied games, movies and when there is Wi-Fi they can play ABCMouse to get some learning in there too. Great buy. Good luck getting those movies downloaded :)"
"Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them."
Great product for kids and adults.Super simple set up that only took a couple minutes!
My grand-daughter was able to immediately understand how to use this tablet. The operating buttons ( on and volumn) are easy to use. Great tablet
"This came in handy when our computer had to go to the pc hospital. It was convenient, quick, easy to use!"
"I use this table to control all of the smart devices in my home. Its the perfect size to do so. Also has the convenience of everyone in the home having the ability to do so with out have to us ""my"" phone."
The kids have really enjoyed playing on their new tablets!
love my fire. its much better looking at this screen instead of my phone. and my other computer is big. this is just right to things I need to do like watching videos or tv in quiet place.
I gave this as a gift. The person that received it hasn't said anything about being unhappy with it.
Bought as a gift but have one as well...love it! Great price!
"Works great. Love the size. Loved the price. Use mostly as a reader, but nice to be able to surf the net."
It's very nice and compact. Perfect for kids 10 and under.
Very user friendly. Nice for travel. Keeps a charge for a long time.
I needed something to travel with. The amazon prime was perfect. I can look at movies and get online and it was cheap and small to carry.
awesome buy for the price. camera rated 5 out of 10
We purchased these for our younger kids (ages 5 & 7) so they could play games and read. Perfect size and they love them! The only negative is that the charging port is very fragile.
Nice for kids. Has parental control for apps and other functions.
I got this to replace an old Kindle that had no light. Works great and the price can't be beat!
Bought this for my mom during Black Friday. The screen is big enough for her to watch her movies and play her games. She thinks it's so easy to use. She was using a little cracked screen phone before so she treasures this.
I bought this as a gift for a family member and she loved it. Great simple tablet.
I loved this product. Excellent for the price. so much you can do on this. Also excellent for kids.
It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.
"I bought the Fire in hopes to play movies from my ultraviolet account. Only to find out that it no longer supports ultraviolet format on the Fire. So, I had to shop elsewhere to play movies for my plane trips. Don't buy if you're looking to play movies this way!"
Love my new kindle fire. Gives me a tablet at a great price. Highly recommend this kindle
"If one is new to tablets, this little table is a good introduction to the tablet world. Much can be learned and accomplished for the small investment. Try one!"
Use for surfing and general use. Had for 2 mths works and operates great . Screen is clear
This tablet has little cpu power and is really only made to work with the Amazon Prime crowd. Not what I was looking for.
Was looking for a nice size tablet when a great price..so far they love the tablet
I purchased it for my cousin. It is a nice starter tablet for a child. Easy to use. Easy to set up.
Its a great tablet for the basics that my grandson uses. He finds many hours of entertainment with it by playing games and looking up general info on line.
"Very convenient! It fits in my purse or jacket pocket, which is a plus, and it has most of the same apps that are available for my mobile phone. I am enjoying my new device."
I love the Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet. The screen view/ quality is great! I was worried about the durability at first being that I want to carry it around with me while traveling however I have not had any problems. I plan on using this tablet to supplement my laptop and will definitely recommend it to others.
"I bought this for my brother and he loves it. He uses it to watch videos, surf the web, and read books."
"This tablet is perfect for me, my kids, and for on the go. It's a brand I trust."
Was a gift for my mom and she loves it. Thanks Amazon
"Great price on Black Friday! Works perfectly as a child's tablet for educational games teaching letters, numbers, math, etc."
Good tablet for the price. Nothing g fancy but my young children like them a lot.
The Kindle Fire 7 is a phenomenal item I bought for child 2 years ago now and she can't put it down. Great alternative to Ipad
Great tablet for the price. It's very easy to use.
i bought this for a christmas gift. my granddaughter loves it and it was inexpensive.
Bought this for my 5 year old nephew that is obsessed with tractors and chains. He had been glued to this screen since Christmas.
This item is great for kids reading! set up a Kindle account and they pick the books! Many free!
Its a good product at the cost. Touch sensitivity is acceptable.
"I bought 2 for my kids for XMAS, the purple and tangerine. The colors were great! The tablets are really nice and they enjoy them. Great camera. The only complaint is some of the games in the play store charge. The same games were free in the google play store."
Purchased for Christmas for my grandkids. The perfect gift to keep them off my phone using my data.
The amazon fire is a great value for the money. Lots of functionality for under $50.
"I got a great price on this item, it was a gift and my mom loves it. Easy to start using on day 1."
"It's a good tablet but only for like little Childen to play on not for teens. I don't think it should have high expectations, if thinking that."
"I had been searching for a reliable and durable tablet for my child, after various reviews I went through with purchasing a pair of the kindle fires. For my child it is perfect, he's able to play games and videos without much issues. Being a young child durability is required as was low cost, this item has more than met expectations. For an adult it is more a passable option as the os can be frustrating and the unit will lag on occasion."
"I'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 iOS devices in the last five years. Honestly, the Fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 2-3x its price. I find the UI a bit cluttered- it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where I want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement- but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. And since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. Too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. Overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so."
I recommend this product and Best Buy to friends and family members
"Very inexpensive, good size and weight to carry, added a 64 gb memory card and I have everything I need, from books to videos."
I got this tablet for my young nephew. I love the playtime feature so his parents can monitor how long he spends daily on the tablet.
"Works good and great price, great for books or music on the go"
My niece loves it! Her sister got one for Xmas and now she got one too.
"Bought as gift, don't know the details, but kids love be it!"
Great entertainment value for my 5 yr old! Just wish it had more internal memory
This is a smooth product. works very well; still have the iPad over it but for the price you can't beat it .
"I LOVE this little tablet, so much I've bought several for gifts. You just need to buy the little 32 GB Micro SD card and you have a fine little tablet, great for streaming, netflix, emails, FB, games, movies, music--anything!"
I bought this for my son and it works great. The parental controls are easy to use and I love the curfew option.
Bought ut for my 7 year old and it works great. It is a great price and a good way to help your child learn about the technology.
Needed a replacement tablet and looked at a variety of options. The Fire was at a good price and is working well.
Sleak littoe device for the price for normal everyday use.
Smooth operating system. It's no IPAD but good enough for the money. Purchased for the kids to eliminate abuse to our higher priced items. Would have no problems buying the item again at this point.
"This is an outstanding tablet, especially for the money. Does all I need it to do at a great price."
"This was my daughter first tablet. She loves it and it's amazing, for the price it can't be beat."

"Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching amazon prime ,YouTube or just checking face book or any other chats. Love to play games. The family loves it all."
If you don't have a tablet or your kid doesn't this is a great option. Durable and an excellent value.
My son enjoys being on his tablet and getting on all the apps he has. It keeps him entertained. He loves it!
My mom loves it! She uses it everyday for everyday us and to video char
I purchased this tablet for my sister as a Christmas present.
"Gave to my brother as a gift, and he takes it everywhere with hin"
This was just what we were looking for our kids picked it right up and was playing on it in just minutes
I love the Fire. It is great for reading and watching movies. I added Amazon Prime and this made it perfect!
"The Fire itself works well so far, the ouch comes from the fact that the buyers Amazon account MUST be hitched to it to download free games. Who wants kids downloading anything that has your credit card attached even if it's free or accessing your account?"
"I like buying stuff from Bestbuy because, it's always seems cheaper than others!!!"
It is a nice convenient tablet for carrying around.
Got it for my 2 daughters for Christmas and they very happy
"Great price, item works perfectly and my daughter loves it!"
"For 50 dollars you cant REALLY complain, it actually will take a drop pretty well too."
Nice price for all you get great product all best buy employees
"GOOD PURCHASE HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, WOULD RECOMMENDS"
Simple to use and great for beginners! I'm buying one for my son too.
Cool tablet kids love it affordable nice gb size awesome
"I was uncertain about the fire tablet since I own an iPad mini. Bought it for my mother and love it! It works smoothly, the system is awesome and my mother loves it as well! I also got the HD 8 for my daughter"
for the price it is worth it... for below usd50.00 you get a decent tablet
This was a great purchase. I love the size and functionality.
Bought for grandkids. They loved it and I'd recommend it to everyone.
Perfect for my four year old daughter w/ geek squad protection
Easy to use. Awesome price. Best Buy had in stock when amazon didn't. Recommend.
Great price for the Amazon tablet. It is Def worth the money just don't like that you can't get real versions of the Google Apps
"The item was on sale over the Christmas period at a great price. Took it home and when I charged it up, the back of the tablet became very hot to the touch and the battery life reduced dramatically. Left it alone, tried it again, this time no issues. Four days later, it did the same thing when I was charging it up again. Sent it back for a refund."
I am so pleased with each and every product I purchased!!!!! Everything is GREAT!
It is very easy to use and i love that it syncs with my phone app for holding my reading spot.
Would like to be able to delete items to make room for more things I do want but otherwise I enjoy it very much. Easy to take anywhere
For the price it was well worth it. Tablet works great and definitely better than other tablets at this price. It's perfect for reading or playing games and very easy to use!
"So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime ""free trial "" I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision"
I bought the Fire for my wife after she started getting headaches in the evening doing Facebook and email on her iPhone. The larger screen on the Fire makes it easier on her eyes and her headaches are gone.
I have one of these already I bought this one for my cousin for Christmas she loves it.. is now able to watch Netflix and the like without having to fight her daughter and husband for the TV..
"My child had one before , and loved it. So we got him another one."
Device is preloaded with many friendly apps that are easy to use.
"Good all-around tablet, able to multitask many things."
This tablet is better than you think you'd get for the price. Decent design and it's faster than most tablets in this price range. Not a fan of Amazon's Fire OS and wish it had Android but most of the apps are available so it's not a major issue. Overall great buy!
Great price for a tablet. Like the size and looks.
I love it my amazon fire tablet . It is great for kids to
I bought this for my dad. He loves it and it's easy to use.
"I purchased this item before b but did not buy a case for protection. I bought two. One for each grandson, They are three days apart. This time I've bought them cases and the parents are happy. They have learned how to navigate them and have learned so much from them. They both are advanced preschoolers, Thanks to this investment. Thank you for b bringing the price down, this has inspired me to have my sister purchase some for her five grands. We are all happy. Thank you again."
my 14 year old granddaughter loves her tablet. She uses it to stay connected to her friends on FB and watches movies on it!
Bought this for my sister in law for Christmas. She can't put it down as she loves it so much. Great product for the price. Has everything she wanted on a tablet. Great beginner tablet and so easy for her to use.
"Bought two as gifts for our daughters. Thought since they recently started to read books again and would buy the actual books or try to read them on their phones, it would make a perfect gift. They love to be able to download books from Amazon and be able to use it as a tablet with tons of entertainment at their fingertips."
I recently bought this as a blind buy for a christmas gift for a family member and they really enjoyed it. Also a great price.
"I bought this tablet for my daughter to watch movies on & play educational games. It takes some time getting used to Amazon's Apps, But so far so good! It gets 4 stars bc the Camara takes terrible pictures."
We are very happy with this tablet the ability to expand the memory is awesome
"Great tablet to have for the kids and me to play games, read books, etc. I just wish it was able to get more of the apps that are on android"
Great price! Easy to setup and the kids will not put it down. It's very light weight too. I bought 5.
"Bought this item as a Christmas present. The price was a steal of a deal! It was easy to set up and the kids loved it. I bought a black, a blue and a red. I even bought 2 more for my friends kids. The children loved it!"
"great product for the price, I'm pleased with the Kindle Fire and would recommend this product to all age groups."
Fun for the kids to play with in their spare time.
"Bought for a friend and he loves it. Using it to record notes for school, surfing the net and listening to music."
Excellent product. Works flawlessly and very handy.
Bought this for grandson because it was cheaper than a kids tablet. Bought a case and it works fine.
I use my Amazon Fire almost every day. So much easier to carry the Fire versus books!
"I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter. She is 6 yrs old and loves it. it's easy to use and she can scroll between programs without problem,"
I purchased this tablet for my grandchildren over the holidays. they are 3 and 6yrs old. they love it . it's easy to use - and they are able to scroll through the programs easily.
"This product is okay, but does not due what a normal tablet can due. Example, social media such as instagram and snapchat are not accessible on this tablet due to it being an amazon product. Had I known that, I would not have purchased it."
Purchased this black Kindle as a gift for my niece after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.
"I bought it for a kid. I asked her about and she said she like it! In add, it is not expensive."
Pretty good tablet I use it for my 2 year old daughter she really likes it. Very practical small travel size device for when we are traveling back & forth on the road. Very sturdy keep charge long time a reliable piece of technology for my family & for my tech needs
Bought this tablet as a gift and I might end up buying one for myself.
"Good to have for smaller tablet use. Lightweight, easy to carry."
"I bought this for my wife who really likes the Amazon Tablets. She said she really enjoyed the very clear picture and how fast it was. Like they say.... ""Happy Wife....Happy Life"""
I am very pleased with my Kindle Fire except for the battery area gets hot after a while. I use my Kindle to read eBooks and holding it can get a little warm.
I got 1 for myself after the kids got them for Christmas and I can check up on them and see what they are doing and set parental controls fairly easily
I have enjoyed my Amazon Fire. It tends to be slow to download but other than that I am very happy with it.
I regretted buying this item.I will never recommend this to anyone
"Amazon products are always great products! This time, the pricing was very competitive and reasonable."
Bought tha laptop for my wife to use she really enjoys it
"Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!"
"Good tablet wish I could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app I use would b more beneficial for kids"
"I love my kindle fire it is very convenient and handy, perfect size"
I cannot believe this came with the SD Card slot. This is by far the best amazon tablet purchased
Purchase this tablet for my mother. Her first tablet to read books.
There was a lot of proprietary stuff that takes away from the actual usage of the device.
"I had a kindle once before, and decided to try the fire. It was at a great price, and I love it."
Good gift for someone. Got this for my girlfriends mom for xmas.
"Very powerful, tablet, can do so much with it, love it! Love the kindle, so many titles available."
I bought this tablet to stream music in my hair salon. Works perfectly for what I need it to do. Love it !
"my son uses it to learn about the internet. down loaded some games. that he can play and have fun with. was a little small. I wish I got a bigger one. but it was a good price. still need to figure out how to do more with it. like take pics,"
"I really like the Amazon Fire Tablet because it is easy to navigate, the size of the screen is good, and the weight of the product is not too heavy. I purchased the first one for my husband a couple of years ago, but he broke it and I decided that it would be a great Christmas gift for him since he really enjoyed the first one. Because I really like the product, I have recommended it to several people who have purchased one."
Easy stocking stuffer or gift exchange. Reasonably priced also.
"The fiancé wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier."
Bought this so my brother could watch his videos on something other than my phone.
Use this tablet for travel - has mini sd to keep movies and files- great for kindle book downloads - fabulous price
Bought this tablet for my best friend for Christmas she loved it.
This is exactly what my wife was looking for. I would buy again.
Best small tablet on the market hands down. Easy bright great touch screen.
Very easy to setup and use. Like the picture or screen. Bought 5 gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them.
I have a older kindle loved it. I love the new storage on this one and easy to use buttons. Great battery life.
Easy to get started. Great variety of apps. Price very attractive..
"Got this during Christmas rush and didn't think much of it since it was slightly open. (They had none in stock and needed 4 of them for all my children ) upon opening item , one had a small crack (bearly noticeable ). Increased useage of item cause the screen to spider web... tried to return but no help with management .... store at fountains in El Paso Texas . So I have 3 perfect kindles and one cracked .... very disappointed 1 star"
Great basic tablet for kids and novices. Worth a try
This tablet was purchased as a gift. I've had 2 other Kindle tablets and they've always been great. Can't beat the price.
"great price, great screen and resolution, easy to use and good performance for less than $50."
I love it! Loaded lots of things for my self and kids. The price was also great !! Even my kinds can use it easily . I have recommended it to many of my friends and family . Enjoying it to the fullest . I use over wifi and with my internet as well
"This is great for the beginner, not a big investment."
this was just what I needed for surfing the web and watching hbo to go as well as amazon prime and all the books you can get. good product!!!
This is my third Kindle. At the $49. price this is an incredible tablet. I highly recommend this product.
"Does the job well, great for kids and adults. Was on sell for only $40 during Black Friday. Good buy."
"Can't beat this product for the price. Good screen quality and decent speed. Cameras aren't that great but it's not really for pictures. Overall, a great product!"
Good value tablet. Better than non brand cheap tablets.
My kids use this tablet. It works great! I think I got more than what I paid for. Can't expect more for approx $30.
The tablet is good for basic uses and is low cost.
Good for a basic entry tablet. Plus u can upgrade the memory on it which is a plus.
"I bought one for myself and a few others for a raffle. This is a great tablet for a great price. It doesn't have all of the apps that the google store has, but Amazon underground has some great free apps. It's got good external storage options and a fast processor. I highly recommend."
"The Fire is very much so as it's slogan suggests, a sensible tablet. Inexpensive and versatile, highly recommend"
"Bought 3 of these for Christmas presents and one for myself. Other than not allowing Crunchyroll app it does everything quite well! Internet, photo storing and editing, movies, email, games - great!! App store covers all the needs and mostly free! Love em!"
I ordered this as a Christmas present for my wife. She fell in love with it!!!
Purchased for my son for Christmas and he loves it /. Great price
This was a gift therefore I cannot have a very good review of the item.
"For the price this tablet is not bad (it was a $35 black Friday purchase). It does Amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. It is not a truly ""open"" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by Amazon (i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store). Some apps do not run on this tablet (presumably due to system specs). I think I had trouble getting Disney Channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.But for $35, it's hard to expect too much."
"This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime."
my daughter loves it its very easy to use i got the child proof case also
"Got this tablet for $35 for an older family friend and it is simple to use. Certainly doesn't have a ton of capability, but is more than adequate for basic email, web surfing and taking photos/videos."
once I learn how to use all of the apps I am sure I will enjoy it more but I do have trouble scrolling
I bought 2 of these for my niece & nephew! They think I'm awesome now!!! I'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.
"This tablet is a great deal! Simple to use, my son loves having access to all his favorite shows and games without having to ask to use my phone."
This is a nice tablet with quality that I would expect from a higher priced unit.
It's a great for reading books but it's not that great when it comes to everything else.
Easy to use. Easy to download books. Easy access to the web.
"excellent product able to get on the internet for movies, research, games communications, web surfing."
"Gave this tablet to my daughter for Xmas, now she can enjoy playing her games on the tablet"
we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.
"I got it for my 11 year old and she loves it. She can get email, help her with homework etc. The only downside is we can't figure out how to get Google apps."
"I bought 2, 1 for my wife to replace her older tablet and 1 for my grandson, who is 8 yrs old. They both love their fire. My wife has told me it is fast and easy to operate while my grandson takes it everywhere and plays games on it."
Bought this 1 because of the camera and good price
Great tablet so far. I bought it as a gift andhave heard no complaints
"I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter. The camera, space, and design work perfectly for her. She loves it!"
"The kindle is perfect for fast browsing, reading ebooks, my kids love the product and I am now using the tablet for work. It fits perfectly in my bag and with the swipe method I can type a lot faster."
I have been using my phone to play games and Facebook. This Tablet is awesome. Wish I had bought several more for my grand children.
It's very easy to navigate threw! My child loves it!
I bought two of these as Christmas gifts and my little sisters absolutely love these!! Almost as fast as my iPad. Hopefully they continue to work this way.
"Got ir in a deal for black friday, worth the money paid!"
Somewhat substandard. iPads are certainly better. But it gets the job done for $50.
"I bought the table as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old. Perfect for children or beginners. Decent speed, only complaint is the camera (very bad quality camera)"
We bought it for our kids and they love it its really easy for them to use it
"I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it."
We purchased this for mu husbands mother and she seems to really be enjoying it and it seems user friendly for her
"A bit slow for some games, but for general browsing and reading it is more than satisfactory. I think it is great for its designed purpose"
I like the size. Easier to travel with than my laptop.
The tablet is really good for the price. Great deal.
worth the price and pretty useful around the house
My son was very pleased when he saw the kindle fire. He loves it and it is great for him because he like to read his books online.
Easy my kids love it....easy set up ....easy to use
"It took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. The video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. I love the convenience of having a smaller tablet - my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. That said - in sleep mode it lasts days. Very happy, and will be purchasing a larger Fire tablet in the future."
"I bought this for my kids aged 7 and 3. It's strong, bright, light weight, affordable and easy to use. I have never used any of the Amazon Fire products so there was a learning curve but and hour later I feel like a Fire pro."
"This was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. We have had 3 other tablets in the past (all different brands), and she tells me this is the nicest one so far. We have only had it for about a week, but it has sure gotten it's use :) Very happy with this purchase."
This tablet is great for the kids. And it was cheap when I got it. Its recommendable for kids when they play games
"I was hesitant to buy, thinking the tablet would not be very good, but for the price of $49.99, it's been great for my teenage niece. She uses it to watch movies, FB, You Tube, and web."
The fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. The charger is shorter than it should be. My son likes it
Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.
"My son loves this. We've had two other tablets, both cost about the same as this. The others were pretty unusable. This table is fantastic, definitely great value for the money."
"Very hard to set up child profile without paying for a subscription to freetime. Once I got it finally set up though, runs smoothly, but battery doesn't seem to last very long."
"I decided to buy my son a tablet. After lots of research, this turned out to be the best one for it's price point. It even has expandable memory! So if you want a simple go to tablet I highly recommend this one!"
this is a great tablet at a great price. it is very user friendly.
"For the price I think this was a ""Best Buy"" it made for a great Christmas gift"
I bought this for my 3 and 2year old and it works the same as a free time tablet but for a fraction of the price
"Easy to set up, easy to use. Good for throwing in your bag and having access to books all of the time"
"Easy to use, great gor reading, easy to download books"
Great tablet for the cost. Camera's quality is poor but other than that its a great tablet for the money.
very easy to use. this is just perfect size to carry with me
"First time tablets for the childeren. Great gift at a great price, the parents love them too. Basic tablet with many features that are very useful to the whole family. Not too sure about battery life just yet."
"Love the Kindle FireGreat size, Good Resolution, Alot of Apps"
Got it for the kids great find just the best first tablet
This is very easy to handle and perfect for the kids
This is a great tablet for this price. Display is very nice and you get all the features of Android in this. The camera and speaker are not so great though. Excellent gift for new tablet users.
Got this for $35 on Black Friday. Even if I paid full price I'd be more than happy with it. Nice and portable and does everything you'll need.
For the price this was an ok purchase...the camera picture is not very good to say the least but overall ok for the price.
A fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.
"Purchased two of these tablets for Christmas presents (10 yr old and 7 yr old children). Had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. Pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. No, they are not iPads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well."
"I bought this for my son, He really loves it for reading and playing Games."
Bought for my youngest and he loves it.. very easy to work and fast downloading. Great investment until he wants the real thing..
"This is for our 2 year old. Yes, she is 2 and yes she knows how to use these. This tablet is perfect for simple use, children, reading, etc. I wouldn't want to boggle it down with hundreds of apps, but this does it's job and was a great deal at that price!"
Bought as holiday gifts for older kids. They loved them. I helped set up and you can tell the quality of the product by the way it feels in your hands. Very quick processing. Suggest buying micro sd cards for additional storage space. 8GB isn't much.
Bought as presents for the grand-kids. Perfect size for them...perfect price for us. Win Win
"This was a great christmas gift, for the person that I bought it for. They asked Santa for it, and it looks like he came through again this year. It may be a while before I get a thank you, cause it came from santa---- Check your santa mail box. they might say how much they liked it."
The amazon fire i bought for christmas works great.
My kids love there kindles. They want put them down. This was a great Christmas gift
"This tablet is great for a first time tablet owner, just smaller than my current one."
I ordered several of these to send to family in Haiti. They were on sale.
Bought this for my young cousins and they love it!
"really slow but for 25 dollars who am i to complaint, i just use it for books and my kids for games."
I like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.
"It is a great product for the price, does need the expansion card for memory!!!"
"System over-all is fast and I mean for less that $50, its very reliable.The only downside, its uses almost 50% of the internal storage already, OS and built-in apps ... Should have settled for 32GB or more.Other than that, this toy is just ok :)"
"I like it allot, but the memory size is somewhat limiting. I thought that I could save and run apps from the SD card, but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory.Also beware that Android apps will not work on a Kindle. Kindle Fire apps need to be downloaded from Amazon."
great product used by all ages and everyone love it
Like the fact that you can add extra memory to this tablet. Overall great for travel for books and videos on Amazon.
Bought these while they were on sale for the kids. They loved it.
"Good starter product for someone. If you use this a lot, the 8G is not big enough."
We bought this tablet for my 75 year old father who wanted something handheld to play games and read his email. It is good for that. Screen is too small for elderly eyes but it made him feel like he was getting with today's technology . It was very cheap on Black Friday!
"Excelent tablet, great price. It's good for any age. You don't need to expend a lot of money, we bought on thanksgiving and we paid less than $49.99."
Its a good tablet for that price. screen resolution is also good. I have purchased for my friend.
"If you want a tablet to watch movies and use with Prime, this is awesome for the money. Not great to browse with but will get the job done. Can't beat for $35"
"I can't believe it's so cheap now. I had the previous model and it was great. I mostly use it for reading, but it's great that you can add other apps to pass the time."
For the price this tables does everything I need. so far.
This is a great entry point into the tablet market. This was a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it. It is a bit on the smaller side but he wasn't sure if he would want a tablet. So far he really seems to be enjoying it.
"can not down load any apps from goggle play, didn't know amazon and goggle don't have agreements to sharge"
My son was excited to get this and it kept closing on him. Returned it but they don't have any in stock to exchange. Frustrated and my son is upset
So far I have bought three of these of tablets and they love it
the only bad thing I could come up with would be the battery doesn't last that long. otherwise this tablet is great for the money does everything an apple does and can add to the memory witch is fantastic.
"This is a gift to my daughter, she likes to play games and web browsing with it, and she is very happy with this tablet."
"Got this tablet on Black Friday. I love how easy it was to get this tablet up and going. Now I don't have to use my phone to get on the internet. If you are looking for an affordable tablet, this is the one for you."
Bought two of them during the Thanksgiving sale for $35 each. I mainly bought them for gifting purpose but used one of them myself and was not disappointed. You get what you pay for but for $35 this is the best gift that someone is going to receive.
The Tablet is good for Kid's Basic use to watch Videos and play few games. Touch should be improved.
i am glad i got them for my grand children they r enjoying them
"Great tablet for the grandsons. They love it and it fits all their needs for Facebook, Email, and reading"
Keyboard is a must for ease of use. Sometimes apps don't want to close.
We are enjoying our TV with the surround system. The picture is great as you can see detail's in people and back ground we didn't notices before. We need to get a new dish receiver to move the TV to its new location were we will be wireless.
"i bought two of these to gift, but i kind of want to keep them for myself."
Purchase was good. Very easy to set up and use. Clear screen. Easy to charge. Would like more storage.
His is a very economical entry level tablet. Great for kids or for first time users.
"I brought this tablet for my mother, who's never touched a computer, and she loved it. It's great for beginners, and well worth the cost."
"Got this for my son, great inexpensive tablet for a beginner."
Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!
I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.
Real good deal. Nice present for those who want a tablet
Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .
This is a good beginning tablet. Works well and has lots of preloaded apps to start you off.
I was impressed how good this tablet is for the price that i paid. Really good tablet for the kids.
I got this for my 2 year old nephew he loves it and it is pretty quick the one down side is that Amazon charges you $15 if you want to remove the adds that are in the lock screen but besides that the device is perfect for him to play games and watch movies
"Great and clear looking screen, with a 3d effect. Easy set up. Loving it!!"
Well priced. Easy to operate. Fast and efficient. Great product.
Nothing fancy. A good budget tablet that does what It suppose to do
Bought tablet for my five year old nephew. Is affordable and has good specs. Easy to use. Camera and video are good. My nephew has no problem using it
"Bought this for our 7 year old son for Christmas. Took it on a 1,000 Mile drive and it was great for watching movies and playing games. Only complaint we have is he was unable to download Madden Mobile on it. Not sure if it's the operating system or something else. Great size and would highly recommend as a cost effective tablet."
"Bought them as gifts for my nephews, who are teenagers, and they love them. Obviously you cannot expect them to be as high quality as the $400-500 tablets, but for $35 on black Friday they will serve their purpose."
Good battery life. I don't have any problems connecting to Wi-Fi.
It was a great buy at Black Friday easy to use very portable
This table is realy nice for starters. This table have lots off free apps. It's easy to use and u can put in an sd card for more space.
"Yes, you get ads on the lockscreen but the Fire OS has improved do much that it makes up for any shortcoming. It's a great tablet for the price"
Good for little ones who are just getting started on apps.
"I am not highly technical and this was easy to learn how to use. It is small enough to be easy to carry. I have been able to download the few games that I play. So far, I can't find a single thing to be unhappy about!"
"It is an excellent tablet, however it's app store is not as good as android."
Purchased this as a christmas gift for my mom who isn't to tech davy. She loved it and says its easy to navigate.
"I purchased 3 of these on the BLACK FRIDAY sale ($34.99 each) and received them in 2 days! Had to wait until Christmas to have them opened by my kids to see their potential. Great tablet and features (especially kid mode) but have only one complaint so far.....one of the tablets had a BAD DIGITIZER right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. Hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should NEVER happen right out of the package. However Bestbuy is doing everything to make sure I'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available (completely sold out everywhere). Other than that issue this tablet is user friendly, fast processing/web browsing, decent battery life and great WiFi connection (doesn't drop signal like other tablets). Would recommend!"
If your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use.
The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.
"$50 for a tablet, yes please! I gave it a whirl and what a great tablet for the cost. Its pretty quick in the apps, i thought it might lag or be a little slow, I was wrong!"
"You can download free apps, take good pics and the resolution looks great!"
This is a fantastic tablet. I take it to workAll the time.
I should've bought more when I had the chance. It's a compact tablet and good for the value.
The price is perfect and the portability can't be beat!
new tv is great.wife enjoying books on kindle..!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Good for beginners. My staff really liked this treat for christmas
Gave this as a gift. Grandson loves it. We liked the low price.
My step son never really used a tablet before and he has no problem picking this up and just using it.
"U can do so much with this tablet, compare to the more expensive ones"
This tablet works wonders great price my grandchildren love it . My granddaughter love downloading books my grandsons enjoy the games.
For an android powered device and no google support it works alright
"This little tablet is just what I needed. Easy to use and functional with a good display. For cloud access, reading email, internet, using apps, music and photo storage what more can you ask for. Expandable memory this really has nearly everything you could want on an inexpensive device. Don't worry ads don't get in the way they are only one the first screen."
This was a gift for my daughter. It's easy to use and can do a lot
Bought for kids like how sturdy they are my son has dropped his twice and it must keeps on going. Also. Added Amazon prime which is a great deal.
Bought thd Fird for my daughter and she uses it primarily as an e-book reader.
I'm so happy with my purchase. I use it mostly as a Kindle. It's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. Proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. It performs better than I expected for a $49 tablet . My wife returned her $800 iPad Pro after a week of comparing the two devices. Only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. Both are minor issues.
"A no frills budget tablet. Although it can do some light gaming, I would not recommend it for that, Its best at watching video, browsing the web and reading,"
A cheap tablet that is a very good bang for your buck.
Great tablet especially for the price.Brother loved it for Christmas.
"Bought it for my 16yr old for Christmas and she loved it...uses it to surf the internet and social media. Also uses it for movies and music. Great deal for the price, would recommend."
"purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.....AND IT WON'T CONNECT TO ANY WIFI THAT NEEDS A PASSCODE OR PASSWORD BECAUSE IT HAS TO HAVE CORRECT TIME!!!!!!! THIS IS 2016 TECHNOLOGY AMAZON? I've had many devices, but none that make you find a WIFI without a password (hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi...) all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!!!Returning it tomorrow!!!!!P.S. ALSO AN ISSUE ON THE AMAZON FORUMS, SO I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE DEALING WITH THIS!"
"I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input."
Great item for a fraction of the price of an ipdad
"Purchased for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas, I don't think she's put it down ever since. I also downloaded Skype (to replace facetime) so that she can speak to relatives through video."
"This tablet was a great buy. The price was lovely, so I purchased three of them for my nephews for Christmas! They love them! They've been very functional for what they are being used for. I have no complaints and they don't either!"
Good deal. I recommended this tablet to several family members.
"I picked this up during Black Friday and managed to get it cheaper than MSRP. My girlfriend and I have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. It's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price."
"I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet."
Great to use and I like the larger screen. It is fast and easy to use.
The tablet stop working after the second week. I couldnt find the receipt to return it. Its just beenCollecting dust
Amazon did a fantastic job. I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift and he loves it.
"You give an amazing 7” tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! I can’t imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.I f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value."
"This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!"
It is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a Kurio. It is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.
You get what you pay for. The camera is terrible but I bought it for games and reading. The ads can get annoying but for what I paid for its a good product
"It's fast ,well build would recommend for anyone who has young kids"
"This is the first time that I've used a Kindle tablet. I've used Android and Apple devices before, and this is a different beast. People that are used to an Android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. Even though it looks like Android, the Play Store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the Kindle Store. If I had to do it all over again I'd spend an extra $50 or $60 and get an actual Android tablet."
The screen is clear and great for playing games and watching videos.Doing homework is easier
"Not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. I've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wi-fi. Great for Netflix, Flixter and games. Good resolution, just short of HD, but can tell the difference if HD is chosen over SD when given the choice while watching movies."
"I like the Kindle fire over all, but the Kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. We have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. As a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. We still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. Hopefully one day they will design a better charging port"
I bought the fire for my grandson and he loves it.
"It is exactly what we wanted. Great product we love it Great service, quick and gave us exactly what we wanted."
Good product for the price - my granddaughter loved it.
Brought it for my mom and she loves it . It is easy to use and it works great!!
"Picked one of these Fire tablets up today for the crazy price of $39.99. I didn't really need it, but the extra $10. of was just too tempting. Charged it up, connected to WiFi and all was good to go. Played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. Video and sound were good, speed was nice, and I am really impressed with the price. My wife's Kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. Time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet.."
I bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it!
This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.
"It's great for doing anything on Amazon. However you cannot use Google cards to purchase anything with. They're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag"
"Bought these for Christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! The kids and adults loved them. The adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also."
I bought this tablet as a secondary one and I'm happy with the ease of use and fairly quick internet usage. You can't beat the price for what it gives you and it's also feels sturdy when holding it.
My granddaughter really loves it. She was so anxious to start using it.
"I purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. I was so wrong. I couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. Before you comment that it may be the user, I have set up every electronic device I have purchased for myself or my children (compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems) This tablet would not connect to wifi. I even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. Maybe it was defaulty equipment. I sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. My other son sat right beside him had perfect Wifi."
"This Kindle7"" reader is light weight for carrying around."
I purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use. Very user friendly and have not one complaint!
"I got it for my mom, That's all I have to saythanks"
Great little tablet for kids. Fast and easy to use.
"I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google."
This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.
"Love my tablet, it is now my best of best friend!!!"
gave my dad my kindle two years ago and at xmas time i loved the price and upgrades of camara and sd card
"This is a great table for an amazing price! It's perfect for reading books, playing games, checking email, etc. I would definitely reccomend this!"
"I got this on black friday for unbelievable price of $32. It doesn't have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over 100 gigs.Amazon has its own browser and it was very easy to set up. If you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it."
This is a great tablet for the price. It comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. Don't miss this deal!
"The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those."
The Amazon Fire 7 inch turned out to be a good deal. The screen resolution is better than I thought. The battery is very good.
It's like having the world in the palm of your hand it really is .it does everything you need it to do AND fits in your pockets AND when you hold it the balance is so perfect it's like holding a baby. I highly recommend for the times when your lap top is just too much
Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves it! It's entertaining and easy enough for her to navigate through!
Great tablet for the money. Good way to see if you prefer a tablet or a laptop without spending a bunch of money to find out. Works good to stream movies or surf the web.
This is a good product for the price. It does do the basic things right. It however would need a bunch of features to be added to make it a great product.
I got this for my niece. She loves it! I am happy she is enjoying it!
Purchased 6 of these tables for Christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. The Amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.
Bought this one as a Christmas gift. Employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.
I purchased this as a gift for a child. After I read tons of reviews and asked my nephew how he liked his... It was GREAT for the price i just wish amazon would allow you to sync your google play.Other than that great product and great experience at best buy :)
"This is a great kindle for the price. Smaller travel size with enough power for general use. Does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it."
One has to keep the price of this in mind. For just $40 you do indeed get a lot. It performs fairly well too for the most part. I didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very high/good and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. It's just fine for videos though.. The tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.
Great price only not enough memory I bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. It was a very good birthday present!
Perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter..fire is made well..she loves it to read and to play games on
"I like to read before sleep to help me wind down from busy days, I love being able to quickly download books and take them with me wherever I go also. I use this Kindle to play games sometimes also, but it's a bit slow for that at times. Perfect eReader though, and a great price!"
"Great tablet for the price, the only problem I have had is getting it linked to Mr printer."
"I heard about the Kindle from a friend . So when the BB clerk told me about the Kindle Fire, I decided to buy one. I am very happy that I did. Now whenever something comes up on TV that I don't understand, my Kindle Fire finds the info very quickly."
"It's actually pretty nice. I bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. They've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have Wi-FI. Getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. Everything works just fine. No complaints. I would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips."
"I can't stop using it. It's all you ever need in a tablet, Netflix,Youtube,Facebook,Games,Music,Movies and much much more!!! Great screen resolution and all for an affordable price!!!!"
Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.
"Let's be honest, I didn't think I would be really satisfied with a $50 tablet. But I thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional YouTube or Netflix video so I bought it. This tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. This Kindle Fire is better than the one I paid $200 for a couple of years ago (and comparable performance to my iPad3). It is more responsive and has an expandable microSD slot for more memory. The only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras (only adequate for Skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons (on top...would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device). However, I liked this so much that I'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!"
It doesn't work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet I would not recommend it
This is a good tablet at a great price. Love it!!!
excellent for children school without breaking the bank
Don't like the fact you have to have Amazon prime to use it
I love it because my grandson can use itEasily to play his games
Excellent low cost table. Fair for the price!!!!!!!!
Purchases this 7 inch tablet almost three weeks ago and have been very happy about it. It's perfect for reading. Web browsing and watching Amazon prime videos.
Very happy with purchase. Would recommend to family and friends.
"Kids love this to access Facebook and all their games, it's very easy to set up and use"
"I bought an Amazon Fire tablet for $50 and it's been able to handle anything I throw at it. I even run Kodi and other apps on it. I have a Bluetooth keyboard with word processing app, and even an external mouse for it. Finally, it runs emulators too. Love my fire tablet. It's the best $50 I ever spent."
Great tablet for my kids or beginners.Highly recommend for all ages
Love it!! I can carry it and use it anywhere! I've already purchased 4more as gifts! My family really enjoyed getting them!
"I've bought 2 of these tablets now for my kids, they're a great value for its low price. Great screen quality, everything you need in a tablet and good size. Very happy with them."
This a good tablet. How ever I made it better by putting cyanogen mod on this to use the full android operating system
It was a great purchase. I purchased 2 within one month.
I had a kindle for years. It finally would not keep a charge. I like the smaller Kindle for my books so it is easy to hold in bed at nite. This is perfect.
Brought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it
"Bought this to carry around because it was cheap so if it was stolen, lost or broken it would be no big loss. Started playing with it and this is a VERY functional tablet. While it's not my iPad Pro it is a great little entertainer, reading books, listening to books, searching the web, Facebook, twitter and it's small and keeps you connected."
"I have an I-Pad and the Fire. For the price, you can't beat the Fire. Does what the I-Pad does and was a fraction of the cost."
I love my new Kindle! Very easy to use and a great price!!! I take it everywhere!
"I bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. I'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. It is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything I need. Cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. I don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. Free games from Amazon underground, free Amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me; made this purchase a great decision. It also,makes a great reader. Love this little gadget.."
Bought 2 for birthday gifts for grandkids!!! Reasonable priced and they work great!!!
I like to play games and check e-mail and the cost was great
I own several iPads but wanted to try one of these as I am an Amazon Prime member. These are a STEAL and what a value. The fact that you can insert a micro SD card to expand storage is a huge plus and I have been very pleased with the availability of APPs. I will be taking my this to Europe and have been able to download a bunch of movies for the trip from my Amazon Prime membership. I purchased at Best Buy with a gift card and now use it more than my iPad.
"its good product but it has a big problem , the battery is the big issue for this device."
"Simple, everything works no problems. We bought for my mother in law . She loves it."
this is a fun & valuable tablet.we(three of us ) all enjoy games & the reading stories.
"This a great tablet for the price. Compared to other tablets that are twice as expensive, this one is far better for the money."
The apps offered was as expected. I was surprised that it was heavier than I w pe red.
Great tablet for the price well built and worth every penny
Great Tablet. Its Easy to use and it's kid friendly.
Great tablets for everyday use. My child watches his favorite YouTube videos on it.
"Easy to use, not overpriced. You get what you pay for."
Got this tablet for $39 dollars. Perfect for travel and kids!
my grandson loves it plays it all time loves the app. store
"Wonderful graphics, it met all my expectations. The camera and the price were a great bonus."
So glad I decided to purchase this! I gave it as a gift and the person absolutely loves it.
"I bought this tablet for my little brother. He was used to Google's Android operating system. This tablet runs on Amazon's system, but is more user friendly. He loves this tablet and it was easy for him to learn."
It works good for kids and wherever you need for and good size
Great price for a starter tablet. Easy to use and able to watch video and read books. Only downfall is poor external speaker if not using headphones.
I like to use my refrigerator it works like a champ and it freeze
This kindle was purchased for my mother. She took to the kindle with ease. She was able to navigate through the device without any problems. She is very happy with her kindle.
"Not a bad tablet, BUT not an amazing tablet. It costs 50 dollars for a reason. It is a basic tablet, kind of like having a bigger iPhone 3, if you get the reference."
"Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends."
I like the size of it and it's easy to operate. I didn't like that I had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information. I need to have wifi to look at the stuff I downloaded and I don't like that. But for the cost it's ok.
i love this tablet. but my only complaint is the battery life. it sucks.
I Love It Works Great.Tried To Purchase This Kindle Fire At Christmas Time It Was Sold Out. But I Keep Going Back To Best Buy And Finally They Were In Stock So I Bought One And Now I'm Happy......
I bought this for my parents. It is easy to operate.
"Terrific product. I was pleasantly surprised. The fire exceeded my expectations. The cost was literally a fraction of an ipad, yet it has the same functionality. I liked it so much that I returned the next day and got another for my wife."
"Good basic tablet, but already have troubles. Amazon sent a new one."
I love my kindle fire. It does exactly what I need it to do and more
This is my second kindle fire I love the ease of use with the fire and all my books
My kids love it but if you have ti many apps on the tablet it won't work until you free up some space
Bought it for my niece and nephews as a beginner tablet and turned out pretty well. Value buy.
The grandkids needed some research help for school. I researched and found that the Amazon tablet was the the best for any age. Best But was the best place to go for the best buy and price....
This product is very easy and light to use. Love it.
One of the best tablets other than android out there
I got 6 of them they didn't have google plus me no like
A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase. I have found that it charges fine when using the cord/plug that comes with the unit but charges slow if you use a different cord/plug.
"Performs as expected. An excellent value, especially for lose looking for a reasonably priced gift for techies...or for kids!"
Excellent product at a great price! Perfect for my little boy
I bought 2 of these as gifts for my nephews. They loved having their own tablets. Great price. Highly recommend!
I bought this to replace my Nook since it was such a great deal..it did not disappoint. Great graphics sharp fun games and free apps.
"I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my foster children, and I must say , I love them! The Fire give parents so much control over what the kids can do it. The best feature is the curfew it has on it. You can set it for a time to come on and off, and more than anything, you can set it so, they will have to spend a certain amount of time on educational activity before it allows them to start watching videos or playing games, etc. I love it!"
Great tablet with a lot of worth apps and everything for a low price.
This tablet has been great for my 8 yr old son. It has an expandable memory. Charges fast. Very durable!
"I have purchased several kindle fires over the years for kids and family members and am always very happy with the product. The new, lower price just makes them more appealing."
I use it for audiobooks a lot of the time . It has a good clear sound. Very easy to download books from the library .The battery seems to last a reasonable amount of time.
"Bought this for one of my granddaughters for her birthday (10 yr old) and she absolutely loves it. It has 'parental controls' which is important for her mom to keep her out of where she doesn't need to be, etc. For $50, I think it's a great buy, especially for a young child. I'm happy with the purchase."
"Not the most powerful tablet out there, but excellent for the price"
Love it whould tell everyone to get one buy it you will have tons of hours to do things.
I have to say this tablet is perfect for my young kids and durable!
Easy too use and a plus for wife to read books being a prime member
I bought this tablet for one reason and it has accomplished that perfectly. To stop my 8 year from nagging me everyday that he wants a tablet. I haven't had to hear those words once in two weeks after months of nagging me. Had I know I could get him a cheap one instead of an iPad I would have taken care of this a Long long time ago. 53 stars in my books.
"This tablet is not even and introduction to tablets, it is a full tablet. It does not have mobile access but you can do everything through wifi. Once you download items they become available to you offline. You can even add a 128 Gb memory card so you never run out of offline things to enjoy.The family sharing feature is excellent, particularly the one that allows you to created children profile. Your kids are protected and learn and play based on your criteria."
"Great tablet my daughter loves it, would definitely recommend it to a friend."
The Fire is a perfect tablet and reader. you can't beat the price.
This kindle is fast and affordable. I highly recommend it.
I bought this for my Mother. She loves it. She can play her games she likes and she can use kindle and audible all with just one device.
Really love it. Great display but not crazy about ads but still getting use to it.
very easy to work the only thing i dont like the cord does not plug in good its like it not the cord for it
"Runs great, no complaints. Nice size screen, nice specs all around. Cant do any better for 50 bucks"
Over all my kids love their tablets. I would've given 5 but the fact that it doesn't have a lock to the app store I took off 1
"A very nice tablet for the price. It has everything the more expensive tablets offer. One thing is not so pleasant, the advertisement screen keeps popping up and I so far could not find a way of shutting this function down. However, overall I am satisfied."
Can't beat price wish the cases would fit from last one screen smaller but for the price I think gret .
Awesome tablet and what a great price!!!!! Would buy this tablet a million times over!!!!!!!!
My son really likes the kindle fire and it so easy for him to use
good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet
Purchased for my son for ease of use and design. Would recommend.
"Bought to replace a work issued IPad. Some differences I've noticed:+survives repeated drops off the loft to the floor, unlike ipad+small, lightweight, fits in my small purse or daybag+cheap price means I'm willing to travel with it, take it anywhere, leave it at work unlocked- I don;t worry about theft like with apple devices-more limited apps available than ipad, but most major apps are there (but not my favorite list making app)-silk browser forgets that tabs were closed and always reopens to whatever page you've been browsing lately (but might make for a good accidental parental watch/ control to see what the kids surfed last)-standby battery lasts several days, active use all day, but not like my ipad, where I could leave it on standby for weeks, shorter standby battery life for the FireI use mostly for web browsing, social media, and Kindle books. no other cons noted."
good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black
I have one issue with this tablet. What headphones work with this tablet? I used a pair the first time to watch a movie and they worked fine. When trying to view a movie again none of the headphones are working on this tablet. I have tried multiple headsets with no success. Please Help!
"I buy these often for trade show booth prizes. The customers are always excited about them, and they make great gifts!"
brought it as a gift for my uncle and its a decent tab for the price.
Bought it for 12 year old. Works great and he loves it. Very happy.
I love this tablet! It's easy to use and set up! I love reading books and magazines on the tablet! The apps are great and easy to use! This is an all around great device!
"Great tablet for my kids to use. Plenty of apps to choose, easy to set up and add parental controls. Cheap enough as well for what my kids use it for games and videos instead of spending 4 times as much on a different tablet"
"Perfect for reading, easy to carry, why spend more"
this is the perfect table to download books from Amazon....
Great item for Great price. Functions as expected.
I bought two of these items. The first was for my mother in law. She is visually challenged and it was recommended by her doctor. The second I received as a fathers day gift. The first one had issues that required a return and replacement. It now works fine. Exchanged at Best Buy with no problem. The only problem I see is the limitation on available apps. But that is a minor issue at this point. For the money you can't beat it.
I have had my Fire for 5 years at least and love it. Bought this for my mother. Her IPad died. She is enjoying it. Her only issue is there is a game she can't download because it is on Google play.
Love this Gadget it's pretty amazing for adults and children very useful
"I'm a little challenged when it comes to stuff like this , but it's many functions makes it fun to learn new things ."
"This tablet is great - the size is just right for carrying it in your purse or backpack. The clarity of the screen is very good. You can play games, access email, search the web, etc. Would recommend to a new purchaser."
"Not sure of quality. His first Kindle Fire would no longer charge properly. It was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed. He has already had a problem with this one charging properly; however, I believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself."
Great for everyday use! Price is right! Easy to setup & use!
"Does everything you need for ""daily"" use. Easy to set up, easy to use, price is great!"
A decent tablet. Just wish the app store had some better apps to download.
Fantastic price. Large amount of app to choose from. Good parental controls. Helpful technical support. Of course don't expect this tablet to not getting slow when multiple apps are running in the background.
I love this little tablet. My daughter loves free time app on it. She wants to play on the fire tablet more than her kids Samsung tab
Purchase this tablet for my niece and I must say it's a best product in this range.
A bargain; this tablet is very affordable and the picture quality is very good.
Can't beat the Fire tb at $50. Was able to root it in about 5min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab. I mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great. Only complaint is the processor is little lacking compared to phones with the same specs
A very good price for the tablet. The sound volume is a little low. Needed someone with technical knowledge to help me set-up the tablet.
"I bought this Fire for my son for primarily reading. Definitely not as good as the antiglare ones. If I were buying again for that purpose I would upgrade to the ones specifically for reading. As a tablet, it is a little difficult to navigate. It seems very cluttered. Does the job though."
"We bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. The layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. Once you figure it out, it isn't bad. Not an iPad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price."
Great phones for my sons that are 13 and my 8 year old lives his kindle
this was great for my wife who just needed a basic tablet for web browsing and media consumption.
Tablet was purchased by our daughter with her own money. She worked her tail off for this tablet. She loves it and will be using for school and travel.
Right size for travel. Perfect for reading. Everyone should own one.
The tablet is great for reading and watching movies
The tablet has been great for reading and the picture is large enouph
This product is great for children. Easy to use and very inexpensive. Allows for enough storage and very durable!
The fact that it has parental control so I can verify what they are downloading is great
Amazing tablet for the price i love it is really easy to use and light weight awesome speed
I love my fire... The games and the pictures great
Great tablet for kids but the screen isn't as strong. Charging port is very poorly built
Great product easy to use. Having different color choices wonderful.
"Love this tablet, great price and is really fast. Is worth every penny."
Kids love it to death! Games and tv also learning its wonderful



























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Love my new Kindle. It was time to replace my old one. Everything is so much bet
The price on this. Holy cow. It's a great little device for the price. It's a nice upgrade for my child whose older fire was getting a little dated.
"My old Kindle was 4 years old, this one is so much easier to use. I like the new features. I definitely will recommend it to my friends and family."
Quality of kindle is pretty okay. Just wish charge would last more than 2 hours when child is playing games after being fully charged.
This is an excellent tablet for reading and playing games.
I would recommend this to anyone who wants a portable device like this. It is well worth the price.
My son loves this tablet. I love all the child security i can put on it
"Bought this for my 9 year old, he loves it. Great buy"
"Great tablet for kids. Also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside."
"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably."
What a great product for the $. It does exactly what it needs to and then some.
Bought for kids and really they enjoying. Size is small but compact for kids
takes 30 minutes to connect to wifi and none of the apps work on it and i restored it 3 times already. Big and bulky. you will be better to get the more expensive model
great size and shape clear screen easy to use has a lot of options
"The Amazon Fire 7 exceeded all expectations that I had for this device. It works great as an e-reader, and is a functional tablet as well. You may not get the stunning resolution of an iPad or higher priced tablet, but it certainly gets the job done when watching videos or tv shows. Amazon's app store is also better than expected. The expandable memory (micro SD card) is a huge plus for me also."
Great little tablet for light surfing and watching shows while cooking. Would be better if had native support for Google Play store.
The fire was very easy to set up right out of the box.
"This little tablet is excellent for what it is. I have a Prime account, so there are many features available on this advice with that membership.We mostly use this to stream music in our lounge, and it works well for that purpose."
Great d e vice for reading. I would still recommend a Samsung tablet.
Satisfied customer with product for small child. Very durable. Amazon fire rocks
High quality and very dependable. Very easy to set up.
If u r an amazon customer the fire is a great tablet to shop on
Best tablet I have had load up fast and camera is awesome
Good Quality tablet but the only drawback is that you cannot download every app that a normal android user wants!!
This is the perfect tablet for someone who will just be doing web surfing and video watching. Price point is perfect.
Without a doubt the best bang for your buck amazon tablets are in the runnings for great tablets come in various sizes and definitely will give you apps to fill your every needs amazon hit a home run with price and value highly recomend!!!!!!!!! great for gifts. Dont forget black friday and Christmas will be here soon get your points rolling treat yourself to a tablet best buy will be more than willing to help !!!!!!!!!!
Great product. Best buy had the best prices around.
I use this tablet when I travel abroad. Great item
"We've waited for the perfect Android tablet for our twin grand daughters and we finally found it. These are great for game play, surfing, learning, and growing with them. The display is amazing. Easy personalization out of the box. And it's through the Play Store. Awesome!"
Easy to set up. The parental controls and safety features make this a great purchase.
"This product is simply amazing , I won't say its e,actly like Apple because it isn't and I previously owned 1 while recording , never been a big fan of apple anyways. This product is ridcously good for the price its being seller for ,similar format to an Ifap but not the same and can use wireless internet! 1024 graphs cs count me in , can be used as a car steel as well with an aux cable! I use amazon all the time and extremely am pleased with this product.bought itmstore along with saw series , where'd all the CDs go!"
Excellent tablet for everyday use. It is not as responsive as the iPad Mini but can't beat the prices.
bought 2 for our granddaughters (7 and 9) and they worked fine however the connection to the charger wore out after a couple of months and are no longer able to be charged. I would recommend adult supervision when connecting the charger for a child.
My mom is an avid tablet user and I glad she got what she wanted
My five year old son LOVES his Amazon Fire Tablet! It was well worth the purchase price.
Purchased for my mom and she said it was very easy to use.
I did not receive any instructions on how to begin using my Kindle Fire. I started using it before I came across an important note that I should charge it before using it. I plan on utilizing the Geek Squad to get me started. I have tried on my own but get frustrated when I can't get what I'm looking for in order to operate it. I feel confident that once I learn to use it I will be satisfied with my purchase.
Great for kids. Has many applications that can help kids learn more and easier
"When you consider the price paid for the Amazon Fire 7 tablet, it is much more economical than a IPAD or a Samsung tablet.. I use it to check mail, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites! Plus it is the perfect interface for all of the Amazon apps!"
Brought for all 3 of my kids. Love this product. Tablets are easy to operate and have not had any issues with them. Well worth the $40!
This is a very servicable tablet ... an excellent value for the price!
Love my amazon is amazing for the price I paid and what the tablet does i am glad not pay for a samsung tablet more expensive and do the same
"BEST BUY ALWAYS HAS AN AWESOME VARIETY OF GREAT MOVIES & PRODUCTS TO CHOOSE FROM & TO BUY. EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM BEST BUY IS ALWAYS THE BEST & ALWAYS HAS SATISFIED ME, WITH NO COMPLAINTS. I USE TO HAVE AN IPAD & I SWITCHED TO THE KINDLE FIRE, BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER SCREEN & EASIER TO CARRY WITH ME & TO USE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE I GO...."
Great stocking stuffer for the price and realibility.
My daughter enjoy playing games and watching learning programs on device. Love the ability to secure adult information from kids by using a password.
"Great tablet, easy to use. I used to carry a laptop when traveling, now this does everything I need."
Great tablet for reading and the ocassional surfing. It plays videos well from Amazon prime and the display is pretty nice. A great addition is the blue filter for night reading. I bought two.
I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday. Her sister already had one and the family thought it was a great tablet.
"These were gifts for young family members and they are really enjoying them, but the initial setup was a pain"
"I wasn't expecting to purchase the Amazon Fire but, I wanted something smaller to tote around with me when I needed to instead of a big lap top. The screen is crisp and clear, and this tablet is faster than I expected when surfing around web pages. Glad I got this!"
Good for reading and watching netflix.Small and easy to carry.
Great tablet at a great price. lots of good features
Got in a little trouble with the missus and picked this up as a smoothing over gift. she loves it
"I hate it, there isn't any organization for the apps"
"This is a very good tablet for use with streaming. It does lack some apps like youtube however, since it isn't connected to the google play store. If you are an amazon prime member this is an extremely good buy since you can easily access all of your prime benefits right from the home screen."
Probably the best priced tablet on the market. Works well.
I needed a new tablet to replace my toshiba that had died. The kindle fire is perfect!
"Since we amazon prime it give us a lot of entertainment for my grandson music and videos , good and small investment."
Bought this item cause it was bigger than my phone and I could put all my books on it with a larger screen.
I got this for my 6 yr old grandbabie and she loves it. It is perfect for her needs
Bought this to do reading and store PDFs. Great if you are a college student that has to read many articles. Good Luck!!!
"Keyboard isn't as good as the original Fire HD that we've had for about 4 years. Also the email program is not as good as it doesn't allow for moving multiple emails at the same time. Other than that, this is an easy to use tablet for a very low price."
I am more interested in a reader not a tablet the one thing I don't like about this reader is I cannot make the font when reading large enough
"I purchased this device to use it in my work, and it's really did the job.."
The Amazon Fire is one of my go to prizes for work incentives. It is a lower cost a key that works great and has a name brand.
great starter tablet for any 2nd grader on up great price
Great gift for a young teen.tereat price. Terrific.
This product is easy to use for people that aren't to good with very high tech stuff. My mother likes it.
"A very convenient little tool. Good for checking emails quick, like on a phone, but the bigger screen is nice"
Bought this for my daughter and it does everything it needs to and setting up parental controls is quite simple. Great value
Had about 6 months very slow Started out good but has been getting slower . Cleared everything still not good
I bought this for my mother to use she 75 and loving it
I really love the tablets I brought it for my younger kids
"Brought for my wife, kids took it over! Now am going to purchase two more."
"I bought this for my son to occupy him on car trips. If you are an Amazon Prime member, then this really makes sense to own"
"Great tablet! User friendly.....size good, eAsy setup.."
"So, we looked at the same tablet set up for kids at $80-$90, got this one for $50 and just installed the kids package. Great potty training tool."
bought this for my wife to keep her off my computer when on facebook. worked:)
I was looking for a table that felt right for my child. Loves to read book they already have an app for books and we can browse easily.
"I believe it could be a little faster. Screen isn't very tough, broke in a few months."
This is a great tablet good size and very easy to use.
Couldn't ask for anything better it's better then apple
Great tablet with a great camera for begginers . Has enough memory to start off with
Love the kindlefire...but don't like the operating system....needs to be more like Android
"Its a good tablet, I use it for e-textbooks, very comfortable."
I really just needed a cheap Christmas gift for one of my god children ..
I ran multiple different type of games. Can't handle.
Bought this for a 5 year old and a 1 year old for they birthday. They love to play on it!
Great size. Very portable. I like to carry this one in my bag. Holds alot of my favorite books. Easy to read.
She likes it but it started freezing up. It's fun to her.
"The tablet is a good one, for such a great price. Cant beat it.It is a great tablet and my son enjoys it."
Bought this as a replacement for her Samsung tab 3 that was no longer holding a charge....seemed at first to not like it so much but has grown on her since using for her educational activities and some games from the Amazon app....asked daughter if she liked the fire and she said yeah pretty well
yeeeeaaaahhhhh kids love this and so do i...thanks again
bought for my 5 yr old. He cant put it down. lots of educational apps.
"The fire tablet is user-friendly, a good size, and offers many features. The display quality is good, and i have no complaints with the camera. Using Amazon for shopping or for features associated with Prime is very easy. The only issues I have had with this tablet are that my headphone jack does not provide good sound quality, and there are third-party apps that are not compatible with Fire OS. I'm hoping the app issue will be fixed by developers over time."
The adults and children who received the tablet as a gift have thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Excellent, I love it!! High quality, very responsive."
This is amazing tablet with almost all must have features
"Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching Netflix,YouTube or just checking email. Love play games on it from the app store. The family loves it."
This was definitely an upgrade for my 1st grader. More memory = more fun
Was happy to use this to take my commutes entertainment to the next level
My husband bought one and really liked the tablet could fit in his pocket
It's the best tablet i ever. It has the coolest apps
My son enjoys this tablet as it is kids friendly and easy to use
"My wife and I both got these. We've both really liked them. We had galaxy tab 3s before this and they seemed to slow down a little bit after a year. We're getting close to a year of having the fires, and seem to be still working well. The 8gb model has had some issues with big games, but casual games have worked well. We both like being able to take advantage of Amazon underground for apps. We've liked them so much we bought some for our nieces and nephews too."
Good movies kids. RUNS FAST. EFFICIENT. COOL TABLET.
The tablet is very functional and it is offered at a great price. It had everything I was looking for in a tablet. I am very pleased with my purchase.
Moves a bit slow at times but overall it works good.
Nice to have a tablet and kindel in one. Very easy to use.
I recommend this tablet for beginners it definitely does the job needed to keep little ones entertained.Worth the money great price
This tablet was and still is I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet.
I love using my Kindle fire for reading books from Amazon.com
"This is an inexpensive alternative to a tablet and larger than a phone. The memory is small at 8 GB, but can be expanded with a micro SD card. Plus you are not slowed down by constant Windows 10 downloads."
I bought this for my parents to be more connected into Facebook messenger (they don't have phones) and video calling. It's been easy for them to use and learn -- though I highly recommend a keyboard case. I bring it out to read news sites in their new tablet formats. Small but useful. An amazing product given the price.
goes great for amazon prime users. The user interface is easy to navigate and is awesome for personal use.
Got this because it was on sale and I had a gift card. It is extremely slow using the internet. Hoping to be using it was an e-reader.
Great for kids games and just basic tablet stuff like music and movies
"I purchased this as a gift for my aunt, after Her laptop went out.She is happy with the ability to download apps and play games while in her recliner and even found apps for texting. It's very good for people who are not so well versed with technology and don't require a lot of storage space. She loves it, which is all that matters!"
"Gave this to my 6 year old. Not a big fan of the Amazon app for purchasing and downloading apps, but other then that he has no problems with it."
"I have compared the kindle fire 7.0 to the Samsung galaxy tab a 7.0. The kindle has a longer lasting battery and it has a fire os. It offers a wide range of amazon features such as free e-books, movies, and games that are only offered with the kindle fire."
"I got this as a gift, and it was a big hit! Very easy to use, and kid friendly too"
Great tablet for an older person. I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift for my aunt. She loves the simplicity it offers.
Video files transferring issue. Some files appear.
"The size, speed and battery are perfect for students to use on the go or just hangin in their rooms."
The kids absolutely love this tablet! Grabbed it while it was on clearance and ordered kid proof cases with them also! It's been great for road trips and all!
Great for kids gotta love amazon they are the best!
This tablet is very good for someone that has an Amazon Prime account. You can download movies and games from the Amazon app store.
I prefer apple products myself. But this is perfect for children
This is a convenient tablet to keep in your purse and use for reading. I would definitely recommend this tablet.
this item was cheap and good in use. I had no problems with this item.
"I have owned several Kindles and Kindle Fires, and I have been happy with all of them. If you already are an Amazon Prime member, you can't go wrong with one of these tablets."
"Great for beginners, I had one and then I got my stepson one."
great everyday simple web surfing and apps on this tablet for the price. Good to used it on the plane and watch movies or videos. Processor not as fast as your premium ipad.
Bought for my son. No need to worry about an expensive tablet getting broken. Best $50 I ever spent for him.
Best price I've seen on a tablet that does all what I needed it to do... Just simple things
I needed to replace my old kindle and this one is perfect even has a camera!
This is very functional and user friendly! Great for kids too!
Like it use it everyday. I have 3 grandchildren that live with me and they like playing on it too.
"The Kindle is a great tablet for minor tasks and games or for a child. I haven't had it long, but I'm able to use it for what I bought it for, e-books for school."
"This was a Christmas present for our 8 year-old. It is perfect for kids. It was inexpensive, but it still gives him access to games and educational apps. Much to his dismay, we limit his screen time, but he really enjoys this product."
Nice display--good colors and fairly easy to read. Good for reading. Ok for email. Sort of clunky for other apps. File management is difficult.
Great product compact and easy to get around in. Was able to download almost all my favorite apps
"operating system is quick, screen colors are great. Easy to use and great for reading on kindle app."
Amazing deal. Good product. I am satisfied........
I bought this for my Granddaughters 10 th Birthday. She was thrilled. She loves the blue color and even figured out how to connect it to her cell phone.
It's great for the price. Easy to use and kid friendly.
I like it its good for the kids to play with and easy to use.
Use it for required school work and educational apps for elementary and middle school students
love it for the kids for educational apps and for required school work and web browsing
"great for elementary and middle school, use for educational apps and web browsing"
It was a nice tablet for the price. It's a nice beginner tablet and a good tablet for children.
Got this for my son for road trips and it's been an absolute charm.
I bought this Kindle for myself last year and it's the best $50 I've spent! I hoped that my sister would enjoy one.
"Bought the kindle tablet for my granddaughter and she loves it. I have one myself and I'm always using it when I can. My grandsons want one now. You can read books, play games and use the internet."
I was not expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised by both the speed and ease of use.
"Works great and provides everything you need. Love the parental controls, color, screen, and camera functions. Very easy for setup."
A+ I would highly recommend this product. It is easy to use.
Love the fire tablets! I have 4 of them and they are all amazing. My kids love them
I love this tablet. Very user friendly and versatile.
My son loves it! He plays with it daily. This is his 2nd kindle (we upgraded versions).
"The Kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing Amazon accounts & it's a great tablet for basic functions, like internet use, video streaming, music streaming, apps, etc.etc.etc. However, the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movies from Ultraviolet, which is a pain for most users that primarily bought this device for that purpose. I would currently not recommend the purchase of this device until you find out that Amazon has fixed the issue, if one of your criteria(s) for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movies!"
Bought for my 9 year old and it is perfect. She uses it to play learning games and even to read kid books on it. Was affordable and get's plenty of use.
Love this product it does just want I purchased it for.
This product is very cheap compared to a iPad & works as good!
This is a good tablet. Kids are happy and so am I. Got my stuff back now that kids have their own.
My son loves this tablet. Great tablet for kids to learn and play on.
This product is perfect for reading alongside my computer while I type.
Excellent Customer Service.I encourage anyone to purchase this tablet it works well parent block is outstanding
I bought this to replace a dropped and broken one. For someone just wanting to read this is easy simple and nice.
"I enjoy watching free movies, playing great games, and listening to the various music stations."
"Limited apps, screen not as easy to touch. Good for the price."
Store employees were very helpful. They had enough knowledge to help me select a great tablet.
It's a great tablet. Does everything you need from a table and for only $50
"This tablet is AWESOME to say the least, however the charger port is faulty and does not work properly. I need a replacement for my granddaughter who absolutely LOVES this product, as well as my other two grandchildren. Their Kindle is a staple in their lives!"
great for kids of all ages..........................
Bought this for my mother who is not so savvy with tablets but this one made it easy for her to use.
Nice unit - easy to setup and initialize. I like the availability of the secure digital memory card - can put my music and movies on the card and not take up the internal memory.
The device is excellent and you program is easy and your price is very economic
We got one of these for my mother in law. She mostly plays games and looks at things online. The tablet is good for a minimal browsing and games...not for expert use.
Keeps my grandkids busy all day I recharge it as they take a nap and it's ready to keep them busy all day its loaded with lots of fun games and activities for kids and adults
Works very well. It is perfect for my brother whom it was bought for
The tablets and the cases are perfect for my grandkids.
I paid $29 for the Kindle ($49 - $20 in reward cash were applied) At $49 the Kindle Fire is a steal. The 7inch display makes the 1024x600 resolution appear crispy like any HD. The educational game I purchased is fun and noticeably working. The parental controls are solid and his profile includes a safety browser with pre bookmarks added to Disney TV shows and his favorite Thomas & Friends. You can add in the kids Netflix setup and share content easily between our profiles.
Great for my grandchildren when they come over and then I use it also good for all ages .
It is very good for kids who are looking for reasonable cost.
I had wanted a Fire for about 3 Years but didn't pick one up but this time I did. Wasn't what I thought it would be like.
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother. It took him a minute to get used to it because he previously used an iPad. However, with the help of YouTube, he quickly got it up and running and has been enjoying it."
My child loves this tablet! He is on it all day long! Wish youtube was easier to use though.
"It has taken time for me to learn how to use it, but I have been able to: use on Europe vacation, download books & audio books from library, look quickly at multiple email accounts, & communicate with grown children through Facebook messenger."
"Just bought my Kindle Fire and although the ""Amazon"" and ""Fire"" come up otherwise the product is dead!!!!!!! I have tried the help section but no help. Taking it back to the store. If it would work I would love it."
It great daughter loves it! She loves how fast it is
Best Value I've experienced in years. Great Quality for small cost.
I have wanted this tablet for a while. I had to get rid of my Galaxy Tab 3 and when I got the chance I went and bought this one. I am so happy I got this.
Is very good on the camera and features will recommend
"Glad to get the geek squad back. The tablet is great, best gift I could have gotten"
Think it will work out. Could be missing the larger storage of the 16gb which I bought for myself. Hard to say really.
"I love this tablet! I will buy a bigger one next,I'm tired of cumbersome laptops,and this goes Anywhere,use my phone as hot spot,I have windows phone,and my fire is android...too heck with the Galaxy phone,lol with a Galaxy,lol."
"i was totally impressed with the tablet great speed great camera the sound was a little low. i loved the price and I will recomend it to my friends. The costumer service was good and staff very friendly , Thank you"
"This is a great low priced tablet, especiall if you are an Amazon Prime member."
"I love it, only thing is that it discharges real quick"
I bought this for my husband. He really likes it much better than I thought he would.
I love how my son continues to use this tablet on a daily basis and he is only five years old.
Fast. Plenty of great apps. Nice picture. Lot of fun to use . Highly recommend.
"I got this to replace my iPad. The battery is decent, the quality is good but the sound/volume could be a little better. It doesn't quite get as loud as I would like so I just use a speaker with it. Overall, for the price, you can't really beat it."
Like my tablet very much. Camera good to learn with.
I really enjoyed my purchase. The tablet is awesome and my son really stays glued to it. Battery power is awesome.
It's a good tablet that serves many functions. Amazon is a great brand!
"Got for daughter, easy to use, easy to understand."
"Very happy with my purchase, found exactly what I was looking for when I walked in to the store."
I really like the fact that this tablet allows me to look at Facebook and Twitter and such. I'm thinking about passing it down to one of my siblings.
"I bought this for my 8year old. Perfect for her to browse the internet and access games, books, and other basic things. Parental controls included"
Amazing tablet does everything I need it to do wow!
This tablet is great for kids and is easy to set up and operate. Great price! Bought durning Black Friday weekend but Best Buy still had them available for the whole weekend!
"I gave these tablets to my g/daughters and there is so much that they can do with it. They come with great apps, which I think they will enjoy for years to come. Also the price was great bargain."
"Great tablet for the price. Pretty fast, touchscreen."
"Great tablet for kids, inexpensive and reliable. Sturdy and kid friendly."
"Great size, clarity and many many apps, games and books to keep the kids busy on those long car rides!"
I was glad I got it for my husband for Christmas. He play's games on it.
Great tablet setup was easy and it seem to charge quickly..
The item for my son is 4 years old he really likes it it's a good buy
Not very user friendly. A bit slow & heavy. Burned out pixel right out of box. Noticeable but not bothersome. Still like my iPad after trying fire.
"We bought this for my 6 year old. He loves it. Make to sure to buy an additional memory card, because it's memory is small, but for my 6 year old to play games and read books, it does it's job!"
Love it. This tablet is great for school work and home work and also music for your car.
The fire tablet is a good products from amazon they can be used in so many ways. A great educational product for a child. It was easy to setup and start using.
This a great tablet for the parents who enjoy playing games.
I had no trouble registering this Kindle Fire. I have a plane Kindle & I like the Fire a lot better. It is user friendly even for first time user.
"Would have to think about purchasing this at full price. I got another one this year for the black friday, $30 price. After adding a microSD card I use them for large Ipod alternatives. A lot cheaper than buying the Ipod and does the same thing."
I don't read the books. I'm still learning about it. I don't really even use it.
This is a great tablet for the price! Will definitely buy again
I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. It's a perfect size and very convenient for her age .
This tablet is very user friendly. It was easy to use and a great value.
Bought these for my sons and they love them. Lots of cool features.
"I purchased this laptop for my son and he was able to set it up himself. I recorded and helped him with passwords and documenting. Speed of the computer is average for basic web browsing and running programs. Memory seemed to hold its own and he was able to jump from different programs. With it being an i3 and basic memory, I explained to him how restarting it once a day would keep the speed up. He has enjoyed and used it on a daily basis with no issues."
"She really loves using this table, it's easy and simple. Having so much fun playing games. Her Christmas gift was exactly what she wanted. She dropped it a couple of times with no damages."
I bought it as a gift for a business party. I did read the reviews before I bought it and figured I couldn't go wrong. I know it was fought over during the gift exchange!
Brought this Tablet for a child and she loves it very much
This is great for kids. Plays movies and games and is relatively inexpensive. The processor is not nearly as fast an iPad or iPhone but cost a fraction of the price and works great for kids.
I have a couple kindles so got this one for my mom to replace a tablet I had got her last year. I didn't realize it was smaller than mine but that was my own fault. Works as expected!!
"I know I can pay to get rid of the ads but it's just a bad idea, tablet works fine otherwise. And if your okay with Amazon apps."
Perfect size for doing everything!Multiple accountss- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids a.Battery llife is amazing Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great
Tablet is exactly what I was looking for. Works great.
A steal of a deal on Black Friday and a great gift for young readers
This is a great tablet for the money!! I would recommend it to anyone...
Kids love it and use it a lot. No issues till now.

My nephew love the Tablet I gave him for Christmas
Bought for grandchild who is 10 and she loves it. Easy for her to handle and navigate. Price was awesome!
"I purchased one for each of my granddaughters. This tablet is taking longer to charge for some reason. Otherwise, great quality, runs smooth, and quickly."
Everything work well i like it alot good enough for me
"The basic Kindle Fire is a perfect tablet for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles of an IPad. I bought this one for my daughter to replace her first generation Fire. She primarily uses her tablet to read books, play games, and surf the web. This product provides all those options at a great price."
Thank you they were great gifts for my sisters loved it
First day after purchasing the tablet the screen turned green. Since then it has given us problems with the screen turning green. I will be returning the item.
Best bang for the buck if your looking for a good tablet that don't cost a lot just buy yourself a micro SD an you won't run out of memory
Easy to use. My daughter loves it! The graphics are crystal clear extremely user friendly.
Never have a problem with my kindle fire got 4 of them
"We bought 4 of these, 2 for family and the others for our 6year old and out almost 2 year old. Overall a good tablet for kids, they don't quite understand the set- up of it. Because theirs so many un- needed, pre- installed apps. But they're getting the hang of it."
Daughter bought for 2nd cheap tablet for movies. Great
my son loves it he's been on it all day he loves all the apps he can get
This is very easy to use and lightweight. Very convenient
I have enjoyed how easy this tablet is to use. My 3 year old can flip through it easily. It was the perfect choice.
Loved this tablet before. Happier now with lower price and expandable memory.
My daughters 3 or 4th kindle. She loves it and is always playing on it
"I had a Kindle before and then for reasons unfathomable to me, the Kindle seemed to erase everything when I had unexpected trouble logging in with my password. That was the end of the Kindle. Then I splurged on a Fire and bam, everything came back even better than before."
Does every thing I would need it to. Nice inexpensive tablet.
Much easier then using phone all the time. Love it.
Amazon has a really nice platform and this tablet is fantastic for those folks who do not to spend a few hundred dollars on an Apple ipad Mini.
It performs with no major problems and without excessive load times
"Great tablet and pretty easy to set up , front and back camera and good resolution I just love my tablet"
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grand babies.
great tablet.just needs a way to disable ads and stuff like that..if you play alot of games you should get the 16gb one.
Bought two for my 3 and 6 year old for Christmas and they enjoy them so much. Ease of use and even my 3 year old can navigate this tablet.
"Like it, it's easy to navigate have no problem. I recommend it to a friend or family."
Best product for the price. User friendly and easy to use.
"I got this for my nephew, He loves it I have also got them for my mom and myself. they are fabulous, the price is so low.. you can really do a lot with it."
Got this for my mom. She has never used a tablet before. It's easily setup and durable enough to handle the occasional fall. She seems to like it so the money was well worth it.
Great tablet for my kid. Great price great performance
"Great tablet - great apps and performance. I Love it """
I bought these as gifts. They were simple to operate and you can't beat it for the price.
Great gift for any age. Parentallocks awesome. Expandable sd slot too

excellent product I would buy all mu grand kids one
Bought for a Christmas gift and my nephews love it. I highly recommend
"Amazon Fire tablet has been working well. It seems to hold battery charge reasonably well. It wouldn't be great for the youngest kids due to all the amazon product advertisements, but great for him."
All the products I have bought from best buy are working so effectively. I will definitely recommend it to friends.
"Nice tablet, many apps for android were also available for the fire operating system. More free apps then android."
It is very user friendly device. MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.
Great product for the money.This does all and more than some for a great value.
I bought this gift on black Friday as gift for my tech challenged mom. She really likes it it's easy to use and looks really good.
"Great device, I have one, and purchased one for my mother. It's great for streaming things off amazon prime, but also good for downloading E-books."
"This is the 4th kindle I've purchased, not because of issues but because everyone in my house wants one. This last one I purchased for my 3 year old. He is very happy he can play games like his older siblings on his own kindle now"
I love my new fire tablet. It ls light and very easy to carry. I take it with me often. I have movies and music on it and it is great.
Great Item everyone should keep purchasing from best buy
"Bought this for 4 year old to watch Netflix and movies via Google Play.The entire user experience is Amazon-centric. The OS appears to be Android-based but is repackaged/rebuilt as FireOS. As a result this device does NOT have an Android OS user-interface.I was able to install the NetFlix app but I did not test it. You cannot load the Google Play app, which means that all the kid's movies (i.e. Toy Story, etc) that we intended to play are not available. For this reason alone the device is getting returned today."
This is a great tablet for the money. Runs fast and works seamlessly with Amazon Prime membership. Prime is not required to use this by the way. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment. We havent tried to use this for business purposes though.
This tablet from Amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. The two complaints I have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an Ipads. Other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like Netflix etc.
"This is an excellent product to give as a gift, one of the most reliable brands in the market."
"Purchased for kids, very good product for a great price. I seems durable and I won't be out tons of money if it breaks. Amazon fires are easy to use and I love the parental control feature."
Easy to set up and very functional. Definitely would buy again as a gift
Its a Kindle with Amazon and for only $40. Its a win regardless its for yourself or a gift for family.
Bought this on sale during Black Friday. Disappointed that there aren't more apps available. Will be returning.
I love this tablet because I get it for a cheap price! Followed some tricks to download play store in the tablet. Works great!
"I love the box, lots of features, can use on any tv home and vacation.."
We bought this for my mom. She is very satisfied with this product.
Great tablet for the price. However the battery drains quickly
"I only use this for simple stuff, and so far I have no complaints. I bought it for thirty something bucks and all I can say is what a deal."
"This tablet proves a great value for browsing the web, storing photos and using Amazon. The sale price is truly hard to beat!"
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON TO USE TO WATCH VIDEOS & PLAY GAMES. I HAVEN'T BEEN DISSAPOINTED AT ALL SO FAR. MONEY WELL SPENT.
"I bought 3, better than we ever dreamed for money spent"
"I bought this Kindle to replace my original Kindle that stopped working when I dropped it. I like that the screen is lit so that I can read it in the dark. One problem is that some games that I had purchased for my original Kindle won't load to this one. I use it mainly for reading, and it works well for that . It is small enough that I can take it with me without being too small to read."
"My grandchildren each received a Kindle fire and have downloaded books, and games best Christmas gift ever."
Great deal for the money. My daughter loves it and I'm glad.
"Great if you read alot of magazines, books or plan to spend alot of $ for music and stuff...most aps arnt available like google play store"
"This is good for traveling light but still possessing research powerful, especially in Wi-Fi areas."
Got this tablet for my 10 year old son. It works great as a basic tablet. It was parental controls. He likes to watch moves on it in the car. Easy to use!
the tablet is very helpful when using the internet
"No complaints. Excellent for relaxing to read, enjoy a movie, or play games through the plethora of apps."
"Bought this to keep all my ebooks on to carry in my purse. So I could read when was stuck at the hospital, etc.Well, gee the free wifi at the hospital has a sign-on screen. Couldn't get to that. Did some reading (on my phone) I think I can fix it the next time I need to be there. Just disappointed that it wouldn't allow the sign-on page to display right out of the box!!!"
I bought 8 of these for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. So easy to use my 75 year old mother picked it right up and started using it. Love love love my fire
"Bought this for my 5yr and she loves it. We are still learning how to work it together, but so far so good."
Bought this for my Godmother and she loves it. She is visually impaired and the large font works great for her.
Purchased this as a gift on Black Friday got a great price. Very happy with the quality.
About this as a present for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it because not only can she play all her apps but she can also use it to read her books
How about this for my uncle as a present and he loves it
Bought for my mother-in-law she didn't want afraid of technology
I like this tablet alot but it was really hard to understand at first.
My daughter seems to like it very much. Had to buy micro sd since memory is very small. Very happy.
"Very nice table, for a very good price. Very good for reading, browsing, and basic functions.A little slow overall. And I also miss some better features related to the different profiles we can create. For example, we can create different profiles for kids, but can't put a password to each one of them (at least, I didn't find how to do it)."
"My daughter loves it. Was a little hesitant because of it being Amazon ad machine, but it turned out to be a great purchase"
We loved this purchase. would recommend to others.
This tablet was bought as a gift for my mother. She had an older keyboard style Kindle that she really enjoyed until her new little dog got a hold of it... She seems to like this new very much. The touch screen makes using it much easier than the old keyboard style. The color display and expanded capabilities are very nice too.
I brought it for my grandson. He enjoying his tablet
"Great price for a little powerhouse, tough tablet. This was given to my nephew (3 years old) and he is like a bull in a china shop but this little tablet has held up. It may not be the fastest or the best screen, but for small children or accident prone adults this is a great tablet. It does a lot, and Amazon controls for the younger set is quite powerful."
Granddaughters Christmas gift. She loves it & the external micro SD slot enables her to download a bunch of stuff.
"Best tablet ever, not just an ereader. I've had several tablets and this one is my fav."
I bought this for e-reading. Easy to use. easy access to Amazon for books.
It's a great tablet the price was excellent best buy in boardman ohio
.. I bought four of these tablets two of them I need to return because as soon as my nephew's turn them on there were problems with screen being almost completely white and black in the corners you can't see anything I've checked the settings it's not the city it's the tablet SMH I am disappointed
"gave item as a gift, bought on Black Friday at a great price."
This is a good tablet. I only gave it 4 stars because it is only 8 go. Otherwise is working well.
"There was a ""black Friday"" special to purchase this tablet for $33 and really could not pass this up. It is intended for a toddler in times of ""crisus"". We don't have amazon prime so really it is useless until the money is spent. Product itself is fine."
Great tablet for the kids they can use it for games.
Great tablet starter for kids and also like that it comes in different colors
I purchased this tablet for my grandson as a gift and he loves it.
Gave these as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them! The are small and full of fun

This tablet is easy to use and great for a beginner. Plus you can find the Kindle on sale at an affordable price.
Decent tablet for an affordable price! Value value value!
Bought this for a friend who loves it. Simple and easy to use.

Do not know why I did not think about getting one of these earlier. This is one we just leave around for anyone to use as the price is so great and most of us use it for internet and playing. have not gotten the chance to read a book on it yet but hoping that will change in the new year.
"Very nice tablet. Easy to use, screen is very bright and clear. Nice tablet for the money!"
Bought for my kids. Perfect size (physical and storage) for them. Privacy settings allow for plenty of checks and balances against their purchases.
"So far so good. Didn't like the setup, but once got thru that everything is good."
I absolutely love my Kindle...especially this newer generation! Great product!
Great product for the price. It performs perfect for everyday use. My son likes it for his educational purpose.
It's a really good product!! It does just what I needed for a great price
This tablet is just what the kids needed. It's easy to use.
"I didn't have any expectations before buying the Fire tablet (which may have been a good thing). With the discount offered over Black Friday, I just couldn't resist. Well, I am totally amazed at how good it is, especially considering that it only cost me $33. I download ebooks from my library, surf the web, do my email so what is there not to like? Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an iPad but, for me, it is the ideal portable internet device (even better than my mobile phone)."
Great gift for those who read and also enjoy Youtube
It is a pretty good tablet for the price. The only thing is when I gave it to my Niece for the holidays that it had debris under the screen in which the backlight amplified their existence.
Great product for your money. Excellent quality and features
"Didn't really do it for me. Being an ipad user, this unit was really foreign. If you are familiar with Amazon Fire products, it will be great for you."
Got this for my dad who is not good with electronics. It's so easy to use he is already on Netflix!
It's has the perfect settings for my kids usage. Keeps her away from all the inappropriate stuff n she has easy access to any downloads that interest her. Only downside is she can't access YouTube kids.
this is my mothers first tablet ever so we're getting her use to Electronics. She does love it
Right out of the box this will be a family hit for all.
I got this on sale and you can't beat the value of the item for the price!
"Processor is relatively slow, but it is functional especially for mundane low intensity task. Only board memory can be enchanced with Micro SD cards."
I brought it to have an extra table around the house for my daughter and it didn't disappoint
Very good tablet for kids. I bought a few and gifted them to kids of my relatives
This tablet is very affordable but its well made. For 40 bucks this is a steal.
Great tablet. Love everything about it. Good selection of apps for free. If you decide to buy apps is also worth it. Cheap prices
Screen resolution could be better. I got what I paid for. Fine for browsing.
nice tablet good value for your money kids love it
Bought for my 9 yr old. He loves it. Easy to use. Great product for the price. Love using it.
We wanted I good inexpensive table to get our feet wet. This is a good one if you are comfortable getting your apps from Amazon. I do find the processor to be a little slow at times.
If u have kids or just need a basic tablet this is a good 1 for starters. Only thing I dont like are the ads that show when u unlock it
This amazon Kindle Fire is of God quality. It's a lot faster than the one I had before
Purchased this for my 5 yr old son. I had previously purchased 2 other tablets for him (both different brands) and they both went out within a year. He loves his tablet. He is able to play his ABC mouse and watch Netflix. Easy for him to navigate. I am going to purchase the 16g for myself.
"I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful."
"Good tablet for reading, playing and browsing. Value for money"
"Black Friday deal, cheap and does what it's supposed to. Kept a little girl very happy and occupied"
Tablet was working perfectly. Now the charging port isn't working. Can't charge the tablet. Will be sending back.
The price was great and my kid love it. Just bought another as a gift.
Its awaesome. I love it. The price is worth it to buy it.
Bought this item for my nephew. Loves it. Recommend buying the rubber case also
"I bought as a gift for my mom she loves it it's easy to use. She can take photos, watch movies, browse internet"
I purchased this tablet mainly because of the price so I am pleased with the functions that it offers...mainly accessing the internet and games.
I love this tablet. It has great quality and functions just like an apple tablet yet you save hundreds. I love how it also connects to alexa dot. Apple doesn't have that.
"Great tablet, great price, wifi has great range compared to apple products"
The tablet is great for my 3 years she loves it very easy
Great tablet. My kids love it. Great for the prices.
Good brand awesome use for home entertainment or out and about
"The kindle fire is a good little tablet. Good battery life, easy to use, just wish amazon would add the play store to their tablets but other than that it is a good tablet."
We have this for a gift so do not have any feedback yet
Love this tablet. So easy to use. My kids love it.

I bought 3 more of these for family and they love them.
"Don't know I bought as gift for my nephew, we will see."
Device works great but is really best only for simple tasks
"This was the perfect gift for my daughter. She can play games, watch movies and browse YouTube. Now I can officially have my phone back."
My 2 girls ages 2 and 5 absolutely love these tablets.
"Amazon fire is almost relevant to a tablet, which holds ,post of the feature and respect to processor speed it more than the expectation to surf and listen music"
This is a replacement for a kindle purchased several years ago. Happy to find the price went down and the product is better than ever. I highly recommend as an internet tool for both adults and children
I bought this tablet because of the excellent apps it offers and it's easy to use.
The Kindle Fire is a great tablet. It satisfies my needs.
I purchased the Amazon Fire Tablet because I have had one for about 5 or 6 years. I wanted a tablet that was sturdy and would last because I purchased it for 2 of my grandchildren
basic tablet. Good for beginners. Easy to carry. It can be used with ease.
"Very good price and very good and nice table, with nice pics"
"I set up the fire and Alexa automatically downloaded and that was good, unexpected. I use it daily for news, sports, and some business research. The home screen is a little much at times and I thought it would be fine but I think I would like 16 gig instead of 8 but I can just pop in extra memory."
"Super Slow, Would not download, Returned after a week"
I own a Fire tablet and bought this for my grandson for Christmas as he always uses mine. He loves to play games on it! He is 7 and it is easy for him to use.
My daughter loves her Kindle Fire. Easy to setup parental controls.
We purchased 3 of these tablets on Black Friday as Christmas gifts for our oldest three children. We already have one at home that they share. We all love this little tablet and are very happy with its performance so far. It's perfect for the apps they use at school and for the kids' games as well. The App Store has so many great apps for free...!
"I bought 4 already and So far my cousins love it. Still working great, easy to use, great size for kids."
We use this as an extra tablet for the coffee table and it does everything we need for a basic tablet
Very pleased with my amazon fire tablet. Reasonably priced and works great.
My grandchildren will love them. Christmas gifts..
Got this tablet for my dad for Christmas and actually liked it. Didn't know if it would operate at a decent speed with the low ram but it was sufficient for what he used it for.
This tablet is perfect for someone who just likes to cruise the web and play games! Perfect size and speed!
This item was meant for my mother in law but decided to give to my 17 year old daughter she absolutely loves it
My son loves the tablet. Ha ugh the freedom to down load any app he wants. He uses it everyday. Only downside is the battery life.
I love it my son will enjoy it because it keeps him quiet
This is my first kindle and I love it. Would highly recommend
Just ok even for the low price of 33$. It's more like a toy than a tablet.
Great size for children and travel! The kids proof case is a must!
"G'kids came over early for Christmas, ages 7 and 10. They opened basketball hoop and backboard, a camera, Lego toys BUT they went ""CRAZY"" when they opened the ""FIRE"" tablets. By the time they went home they had already downloaded game apps to play. Thanks for a great Christmas ..."
"Love it, the tablet is nice lightweight you can use it everywhere!"
This was purchased as a gift for our Grandson. He is 8 yrs old and has played games on it almost constantly since receiving it. It has many free games available to play on it.
I guess it's ok...All the apps are in need of updating. Amazon won't or can't update them. There help center did nothing.
"I bought the tablet for games and surfing the internet. This is a slow tablet, not made for gaming - graphics are commonly not supported. Super cheap tablet, you get what you pay for. Ended up returning it."
"I purchased this as a gift (Christmas) for my girlfriend but i gave it to her extra early, it's a very good tablet, got it on black Friday for the price $39.99 she love it. Thanks Best Buy."
"Small, lightweight, well priced, a great entry tablet."
I bought this for my two-year-old son to play games on so I wouldn't panic if he dropped it. It is also a great tool for you fire apps and Amazon Apps.
My daughter loves her tablet. However we had to replace the first one we bought as it couldn't connect to the wifi properly. The second one works fine now.
Good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user.
I bought this for cousin. She is very happy with this small tablet.
Works well but after memory builds it starts acting up. Shuts on and off randomly. But for the price it's ok.
This is my grandson's 2nd kindle fire! Great product and great price!
i bought this last year for xmas love it so much I bought another and I also bought the hd version.
I bought it for my daughter best thing ever I will recommend it to anyone
"For the price and size, ease of use you cannot go wrong, and if you dont try to use it for more than it is meant to be-reader,surfing ,watching content and shopping- great low cost choice"
"Bought this for an Xmas present for my 7 yr old with the monthly program through Amazon he has access to age appropriate books, videos, games love that he is not able to play something that is not in his age group."
"I bought my son a Kindle a couple of years ago and decided to update his kindle to the newer vesion. He uses it for everything, which is great. Love that he can do so much with the kindle."
I bought this as a gift for my mother. It is very easy to set up and use. She doesn't need a lot of space or use many apps so this is great for her to use without having to go to her laptop.
Incredible value for the money. So many features for so little money
My kids love them very good and they enjoy playing there game and music
I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Easy to use and great for all levels

An excelente producto for a very slow price. I reccomend the tablet.
Would reccomend. Bought one for my daughter. Prefer over my expensive larger tablet.
Great product great price wold recommended this great gift
"I purchased another Amazon Fire this year for my other grandson for Christmas. It is a very good buy for a child's first tablet. It does not have a lot of memory but can be expanded. The Amazon Fire allows for games, movies, and digital books to be used. The price is awesome for the value."
It is easy to use and has a lot of great features. It has a fairly decent camera. It is a good size
Great mini tablet. Clear video. Excellent reading. Very easy to learn.
"This tablet is really great for someone who wants a standard tablet experience. Nothing too flashy, but more than gets the job done."
Bought these as gifts for family. Great introduction into the tablet world
Bought this for my son and he loves it. Only thing I wish battery ran longer other than that great tablet.
"I love this tablet, The internet on it is so fast. It is really easy to use."

It's slippery u cannot hold it it always slips and lots of ads definitely not good if u don't like advertising

Amazing tablet. Does almost all things my original 400$ kindle fire did. So very happy with my much cheaper option!!
"I would purchase these again,my grandkids love them."
"Each time that the Kindle Fire needs to be unlocked, an advertisement pops up on the screen. To remove these ads cost an additional fee, so be aware that this is the case. I have owned Nooks previously and they were more flexible in usage - such as being able to read epub books easily, for example."
This was a gift for my wife. She uses it mostly as a Facebook portal and loves it.
Great tablet for the price. Purchased this tablet and have not regretted it.
I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old grandson. I took it out and set it up for hime before giving it to him. He refuses to put it down. I would recommend buying a very good case with it.
"We bought this tablet for our son, is very light weight, fast and easy to use"
"My daughter is six years old, and she enjoying it."
"It's realy high quality tablet . My son love it, and it has many educational apps."
Easy to use. Memory fills up fast though. Battery life is decent.

Great tablet for kids. Good for Netflix and YouTube.
"My grandkids wanted this for obvious reasons and when I saw it go on sale on BB, I jumped at the chance and bought it. The kids love it."
"Would highly recommend, great product great price."
This Kindle Fire is very durable I believe that she can drop it a few times and it won't hurt it a bit so wonderful easy learn product for grandkids
Can't be it for $34 to use it on the plane for the kids. Scrolling down is kinda sluggish compared to my phone.
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old nephew and he loves it. It is easy to setup and very user friendly. Picked up a case for protection.Buy far the best bang for your buck for an entry level tablet.
"Good tablet for adult, it is great when installing xbmc/kodi and stream vidoes online"
My sister in law is in love with this. Best gift ever for her

Got it for $30 on Black Friday great gift they loved it
"I was hesitate to buy it since it was too cheap to be true. however, it is better than my $49 dollar Chinese table that I bought to my kid."
No better tablet for the price. Amazon continues to produce excellent products.
I love this little tablet it is about the size of a large paperback book. perfect for e-reader or kindle apps. small enough to carry around with very little weight. fast processor an lots of free apps you can use. also has expandable memory card-bonus!
"A great product for the price, performs bigger than what you would expect. The memory expansion elevates this tablet to allow for multiple content and apps."
Love it so much. So easy to use even for my little kids.
Works well for the money. Got it from Black Friday deal. User friendly
"It is a good tablet for the kids to play their games on. Only drawback is the way the cord plugs into the kindle. We have had to fix 2 kindles because of this issue. For the price though, it's worth it."
"Good deal, better than purchasing from Amazon, from BB, you get the points, but get nothing from Amazon."
Got these for our kids when we go on vacation. Easy for them to use.
i brought this for my kids and no regret. Make sure you buy a case protector along with it.
My son bought this with his own money during Black Friday. It was his 4th Kindle Fire. Definitely an upgrade from his previous generation model. I love the durability and extended ability to accept a larger sd card. Screen is notably better. He travels with me on work trips and having an Amazon Prime and Netflix account for this thing makes it the perfect travel companion.
Great tablet for kids and adults.Great for price.
"We've had one of these for a while now. Very reliable, easy to use and great looking display. All in all a good purchase for the price"
This tablet is so compact and fit in my purse. It works very well.
Perfect tablet for younger kids. It is inexpensive so when they inevitably break it you will not be so mad.
I only but it for the price. I won't be trading it for my i pad
"This is a great choice for kids is simple, not expensive and a great alternative."
I don't know how Amazon makes any money selling these. The quality is beyond what you pay.
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law on thanks giving and this is the best gift...They just love it to the best
I like the tablet for ease of use. It's a little slow in my opinion. Battery is good
"I purchased the Amazon Fire tablet for $33.00 during black Friday and it has exceeded my expectations. Once I cleared all the clutter of useless apps, I was able to set it up just right for my 13 yr old son. Would definitely purchases again."
Very good tablet camera not very good poor resolution
"After searching in multiple stores, Best Buy had the best deal for this great product. The product works flawlessly from any part of the room. The Geek Squad at Best Buy are one of the finest and best to approach for its setup."
Love the tablet. For this price it's an amazing offer
"I have the first version, and I can't wait to see my son face when he gets for Christmas"
Good starter tablet for beginner or child. Good quality for the price.
I like the product I purchased actually purchased a second one I just have other concerns with Best Buy
I purchased the Fire Tablet for my father's 75th birthday. He loves using it to check his email and to play games. It's a perfect size to travel with too.
Love my tablet. Simple easy to use for reading and surfing the Internet
Great little tablet for the price. Got on sale at Best Buy for $30 on Black Friday.
Very nice tablet for the price. Fast and responsive
This was perfect for my son! He loves it and loves to read.
Inexpensive gift. Should have bought more to give away for Christmas
This is a good purchase for online surfing and checking my mails
I use this tablet just for entertainment purposes on all amazon apps
The night reading light works great. I don't keep my husband up with a lamp on. It is so easy to order books on line and it gives me new authors that I wouldn't have known about.
The tablet is a good tool to help him with reading
I bought 4 then 2 more. Great beginner tablet and great price.
"I had read that the tablet supported gps, for Pokémon go. You can make Pokémon go work, but this tablet does not have built in gps, it uses wifi triangulation. It is great for watching movies, YouTube, and social media apps. It's also great for reading books."
"I wanted a tablet that would actually work, this also has a good camera"
"Really the best cheap tablet out there.It's equally great for those inclined to hack it and make it even more useful, and anyone who want a simple tablet. Works best if you have Amazon Prime."
"Is a great tablet for the kids to play games,learning stuff,you tube and cartoons love this table"
It's ok best for kids I think or if you in to reading books
They are great! Kids love them! They play all there games.
its great for children not costly good for daily use
Perfect for my 10 years old daughter. She loves it and that makes me happy.
Great tablet for messing around with or just to have.

its really good and product and quality...user friendly to kids
"I have bought 5 kindles over the last several years, 1 for me and the rest for gifts. Haven't had any problems with any of them."
"Can't beat kindle fire, already have 2 and got 2 more Thanksgiving sale for $33!!!"
Gave one each to my parents and they liked the gifts a lot.
Quick and light good for car rides plenty of apps and easy for my 2year old to use
Really impressed with it. So many more features and works more like a cell phone than a tablet.
I have a three year old one and this makes it work like a dinosaur. So many improvements.
"Its a steal at 33.33$. I bought the second version of Kindle fire 3 years ago. And its still running great, even with respect to battery life. I have gifted everyone in my relation. Bought around 10 of them for gifting."
It was the the perfect gift for my 7 year old grand daughter. She read 3 books the first evening.
"This is my first tablet, and I have yet to do much more with it than read news articles and comic books. But I really like its picture quality and intuitive usability. My only complaint is that it doesn't support certain Microsoft and Google applications."
"I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it."
We bought this item to be a raffle prize for our Unions annual Holiday party. Winner was excited to get it. Black Friday week deals made it hard to pass up.
"Its not exactly pink, but magenta is close enough. Girls like random anyways."
I wanted to give something to my younger brother without being precarious
"I have a Fire tablet like this, so I knew my granddaughter would love it!"
"I have 2 grandsons that have been wanting a tablet, so on Christmas Day they are going to be so happy!"
A lot of tablet power and features for the price. Kids will thank you.
Bought one at the store and liked it so got one for my daughter inlaw for Christmas
Bought for grandkids for Christmas and they love them!!
A great tablet for my son. It has YouTube and parental controls as well as time limits.
This was a Christmas gift for my 2 year God son and he absolutely loves it
"This is my second Kindle Fire tablet. My first works well. This was purchased for my teenaged son. He uses multiple apps; watches movies; surfs the web; does a bit of graphic design and occasionally reads a book. I use mine almost exclusively for reading and watching Netflix. I occasionally surf the web. Love that it has expandable storage, though I have not needed to use it yet. Would and will definately buy this product again."
Perfect price and just enough memory for anything. Perfect size great quality this is the 5th one I bought for someone. Pictures are great also

The Amazon Fire is the best bargain without giving up anything... So far it has done everything I could have ever dreamed
I bought this tablet (for $39!) on Black Friday to download a few little games and play. Does a great job for that!
Root to cyanogenmod and it becomes a good inexpensive android tablet.
Bought as a gift for mom. I've seen one before nothing spectacular but they work. Fixed a screen for a friends last year. It took maybe 20 minutes so that's a plus.
great tablet does it all you don't have to break the bank on an expensive one this is perfect
Bought it for this Thanksgiving and for a decent price. Works decently and kids live this.
Nice option for an E reader. Bought mine on sale so couldn't beat the price. Not a high end tablet but does the job.
Bought it for my nephew for Xmas we shall see how it holds up for him
"I bought this for my four year old. I haven't given it to him yet, but I'm impressed how easy it is to use and how many apps are available for his age!"
"Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it. Works well, is very user friendly even for a 10 year old and was priced as what I feel was a very good value. I would recommend."
"I use an iPad daily, but saw the Fire 7 on sale and could not pass it up. It is a very solid tablet. I use it to watch Prime videos when I travel. Should have bought the larger screen. It was will worth the buy."
use it for taking pictures of family for memories.
I got this as part of the Black Friday deals and my wife really loves it for reading books on. The battery lasts several days with moderate use.
Bought this on black Fri. Great tablet for the price.
"Good tablet,the screen is a little confusing but OK"
It's smaller than I one I had and it holds battery life good
For the price it's an awesome deal the tablet is wonderful and will do everything that I want it to do for my 4 and 2.5 year old. It doesn't have a ton of storage but that's okay we will be using ours for Netflix and coloring games while traveling!
Greater. Good. Ok. Nice. Ok. Enough. Done. Go get it.
"I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents because I got one for myself last year and really liked it. I take mine everywhere, on the beach, to the doctors office, to my in laws and Las Vegas just to name a few places."
I LOVE THIS AMAZON FIRE. AND THE PRICE IS AFFORDABLE. LOVE IT
I love this table because I can monitor everything my kids download!!! Watch!!! Use!!!! I can control everything!!! Best investment!!!
"great price on this tablet, now if only my kids could let me borrow it for a while"
I bought the tablet for my children and they loved it.
"Looks decent for $40, it would be better add YouTube app."
"Not as good as the higher end Kindles, but nice product for the price point. If you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an Amazon Prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the Kindle reading products, especially now that there is Amazon Prime reading. For even more value and selection, join Kindle Unlimited. In short: This little device and a Prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. I can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then I recommend one of the nicer Kindles...maybe? This one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model; but for reading, I don't believe you'll ever wish for more."
I gave it to my mom for a gift. She loved it lot..
The device is amazing the kids love it. It's very easy to use almost like a iPad.
Just what my kids needed for a road trip. Easy to setup. Love it
I would say this tablet is a killer deal for the price. I bought it for my 2 year old who loves to watch Mickey Mouse and just random baby songs. Works perfect. Best thing about it is....... If they break it... it wont cost you much to replace it. I bought 2 of them just incase.
"This was a gift for my father, and he loves it. He uses it mostly for music on Spotify of Pandora MD he hooks up his Bluetooth speaker to it."
Bought this tablet for my son so he can play his games and keep him occupied for hours. He loves it.
"This is a great amazon tablet for the people whoe just want to use it to read, browse the internet, or play games."
"I love this Kindle. This is the second one I have purchased. It's easy to use, had great background light."
It broke so quick. You get what you pay for honestly.
A brilliant tablet that has further raised the bar for the rest of the competition
I purchased the tablet for my mother. She is a senior and not technological. She has learned to use the tablet to pay her bills which saves a lot of time and stamps. She also plays games on the device that helps with her cognitive ability. Best purchase of the season
It's neat to use. Something I never thought I'd have. At the price I couldn't pass it up.
For the price of this tablet its well worth the money very durable and works well
We bought this as a gift for a family friend. She uses it all the time for Netflix. She is really happy with it.
"I got it to gift my niece , they should be very happy to get it. Product looks good , All the features like screen , camera , processing speed is good for the money you get it."
You get what you pay for. No complains............
"Works great like it should plenty of apps and more, great graphics"
"It is a great tablet, not to expensive. Great for kids!"
Bought these for my boys and they love it read books play games
Bought as a gift for my kids. Great device. Kids love it.
It was a great price bought it for my neiece for Christmas and I'm sure she is going to love it.
"I bought this tablet for my husband for him to use a home. He likes that he can sit anywhere and use it. He has a big laptop and does not transport well. He said he did not want a tablet, but he uses everyday. The only downfall on this tablet is that when you turn it on it advertises some online game and you have to wait for it to go away before you can use it."
Decent product for the price compared to others in the same price range
Very productive product naught for my daughter and she loves it
Great tablet for the price. Not really for reading books.
Perfect tablet for my 4 year old since he was always taking mine. Love having color options to make it feel more like his.
i love diz one cheap&best price last year purchase this product
I got this for my son so I can read him books and he can play a few games. it is easy to use and i Like how you can setup for it to work kid mode
"Very good of a steal almost 50% off, not the best tablet but good for the price"
I love the way we can program it for my grands....
Excellent tablet great for reading.This tablet is also good 4 games but could use longer battery life
I didn't realize that you can't even put Youtube or similar apps on here. Ugh. Had to return product and get a different one.
Overall a great tablet for the price. Able to use this for work and play
Did not realize how small it would be but it seems to do the job...Still learning how to use but have a free Geek Squad appointment this week to review and setup. Love that about BB.
I love my kindle. Bought this one for my mother in law. Plan on putting her on my Amazon account then we can share books. This way she will always have books to read and not have to pay for them. Luckily we like the same authors.
Awesome little tablet for the price. Not an iPad but fine for just watching Netflix and other small tasks while on the go.
I bought this for my nephew and neice. Off the charts!!! They're learning at an ecellerated pace.
Got this for my 6 year old. She really enjoys it for playing games. Pretty good built-in security features
I purchased this for my niece and she loves it. It's the perfect size for her to bring along with her any where she goes.
This is the second kindle fire I have bought. The first one is almost 2 years old and works perfect to date. My 4 year old daughter plays with it and has dropped it several time without damaging it and it had no case on it. For the price this is the best affordable tablet. Especially for children. Great Buy.
"When i opened this tablet there was a white line in the bottom corner of the screen. Everything worked fine but that line was bothering me. I returned it to the store and got a replacement but it had another white line. Other than that it was a good tablet, it is very affordable"
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO WHEN HE VISITS COUSINS WHO HAVE TABLETS. ITS NOT A TABLET BUT HE HAS NO COMPLAINTS
the tablet is great for kids. it's ok if it gets damaged because the are so cheap compared to an ipad. easier to just got get at BB
"Perfect tablet for the price. Does everything incredibly well, snappy performance! Thinking about getting a second one! Expandable memory is a massive plus."
Great tablet for all your day to day needs at a fraction of the cost of other brands
Very good for my 6 year old boy who likes to play games
couldn't go wrong with the amazon tablet for $50 best deal there is only at Best Buy!
This tablet is great for the young kids gift ideas.
This product is exactly what I needed and exactly as advertised.
Bought this on Black Friday. I think my kids will love it.
"Worked good for a month, the kids loved it but then just went black and wouldn't come back on. Sending it back to get a new one with the warranty."
"Works Great , Great Item , Easy to Use & Easy to Download"
Great gift for Christmas for children! Inexpensive as well
"For $33 during black Fri and even the regular $50 this is a steal. Performance, battery life and ease of use are great. Several profiles in same tablet an added bonus!"
Purchased this for Christmas for my daughter. Its small size allows it to be easily carried around and handled and she will enjoy reading kindle books on it.
This gift was given to a relative who is hospitalized for an indefinite period of time. Perfect way to stay connected; great alternative to purchasing hard copy books.
Best Tablet you can buy for the money so hurry and get yours.
"Great price. Bought thanksgiving day online. Could have picked up at store, huge supply. I got blue online, only black in store. Basic but worth the $33!"
Fantastic deal for price. Does everything I need and then some.
Tablet was purchased on sale and worth it.It holds a good amount of memory. Lots of games can be downloaded.
Both my daughters have had kindle for several years and love it. Purchased their brother one
I wish I would have purchased the Fire before I bought my iPad mini. I would have saved over $200!
"I love this tablet more than my Ipad! I bought this item for both my son's, ages 7 &8, they love them! They are inexpensive and very easy to use also easy to set parental controls. They play all thier favorite apps and games watch movies... for free. I wish there were more options or variety on protective cases. Otherwise, it's an awesome product for any age!"
Love this product so much that I have purchased 3 now
"I picked this up on Black Friday when it was $30. It seemed like the parental controls would make it good for my kids. I'm not sold. While I can sideload the Google Play store, you can't access anything you download from the safety of the child's account. In addition, 8 GB is practically useless."
"I was looking for an inexpensive tablet that would be fast, cheap, and do simple things as reading, internet, and music. So far it's been great and on top of it Amazon released an update that adds Alexa to the tablet, so now you can ask questions to it, do notes, ask her to order you items, and also get her to play music from Pandora, Spotify, etc. Great buy!"
Good product and excited to use it bought some for our kids
"Not the best tablet, but for the price on black friday I couldn't resist. Great for a couple of teens."
Got this as a tablet I would feel ok to lose. It is better than expected.
The tablet was everything I was looking for for my little girl thank you so much for making such an amazing tablet
This is a great tablet for young and old alike. It has a track record of reliability and ease of use at a great price.
Bought for a Christmas gift. Works great for anything we have tried to use it for. Great reader!
High resolution screen with very clear and vibrant color representation.
"Its a simple tablet, but works great, good picture, you can do most the same as other major named tablets.It works for me."
Love that the memory is expandable! The kids are going to love it.
I originally bought this tablet for myself. But my kids quickly saw the appeal and started using it. It's been a great purchase and my kids have had a lot of fun with it. And the prices is really unbeatable.
I bought it for my Dad to play games and to download books on it so he won't drain his phone battery.
I like the tablet it has a slot for a memory card for extra storage. It is easy to use and inexpensive.
This is a nice budget tablet especially as a starter tablet.
My kid loved hers so much that I bought one for my son. Wonderful and easy for the kids!!
Very durable and easy for my 5yr old to use. The price was just a plus.
I am purchasing this tablet for my younger cousin as a starter tablet. But we will see how well it holds up with his rigorous activity and game playing.
I bought this for our foster child as a Christmas present
The fire does a ton and costs very little. I really like it
This is a Christmas present so it hasn't been used yet
Screen is very clear and it is easy to use. Great product for the price.
My Grandson love this tablet it's great for a 6 year old
Nice tablet. Screen is clear even though not high level HD. Amazon features with android capabilities work well!
Great price and easy to use. Perfect for using while traveling by car.
I have all tipe of tablets. My favorite is the apple but I prefer fire tablets better than Samsung any time.
Seems to be great quality for the price. Works great.
The Fire is a good handy tablet. So far I have not been able to download a document from something other than Amazon. The document I am trying to download is the reason I bought Fire in the first place.
"I bought this to take on vacation and I love it! I use it to read ebooks, watch Netflix, check my email. Definitely gets the job done."
It's continent for my son but is too slow to connect to wifi
The service that I received was terrific. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely recommend your establishment to my friends and family
Great price for a Kindle as a present for your kids
Great simple tablet for younger children to use...
"My child is having the time of their life, great for small hands."
This item is ok if your not looking for a big name brand tablet.
"It's the perfect table for kids (personal situation) has almost same applications the most tables has, with affordable price.You will be happy with your purchase:)"
Perfect fit for what i was needing. Might get another soon.
"Got this for my wife and she loves it, it's small but runs great"
Purchased for youth gift as starting tablet. The Best Buy Cyber Monday one of the best price for purchase. Will be able to determine operation of such once the tablets have been opened and operational.
Bought this for a gift and now buying one for myself. Very portable and easy to use.
It's very nice and useful. I will recommend this product.
"Bought 2; Great Tabs for kids, economic and sturdy; great buy for the Holidays !( Now the leave my phone Alone ! )"
I got two of these for my kids. If they break oh well. Good for a step up from leappad.
My organization was tasked to give gifts to needy children. So we figured these would be great gifts for the older children since they rarely get gift that they could use.
Bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didn't purchase the accidental coverage last time. He is only 8 but loves to play games on it. Since it's linked to my amazon account I can see what games he is downloading and control the purchases made. Definitely a must have for long car rides!
My first Kindle must have been defective as it was overheating. Because I bought it at Best Buy (and their return time was over) and not from the company all they would do for me was give me a discount on a second one. I finally accepted and the second one has worked perfectly. This is a good option for a cheap tablet.
I purchased this gift for a family who didn't have much and I wanted to bless their kids with something nice. This made their day and was exactly what they wanted. I purchased two of them originally but now I might buy two more.
Our family isn't from Ohio so when we travel back home we like to have something for the kids to do. I didn't want something super expensive because of course theyre 3 and 5 so not the most responsible. These worked perfectly fine for them.
I brought 3 tablet for my grandkids and the love them. Its easy to operate and block off other web sites to make it kid friendly
"This is a great tablet, lite, portable, exceptionally fast and plenty of space for everyday internet browsing and/or YouTube watching."
"The Amazon Fire is a great value for the cost. It is a nice size tablet to take on the go, watch movies and videos and check your social media sites and email. It's a great gift also. Even for those who have iPads and laptops. Very convenient and I highly recommend it for all ages."
Bought 2 for my kids great price well worth it. Works great on wi fi
This tablet is very reasonably priced for children and I love the insurance replacements. Must have for the young ones.
This is my second Kindle Fire and it is even better than the first.
"THIS IS MY 2ND TABLET AND THERE IS NO BETTER TABLET FOR THE PRICE, GREAT SCREEN AND FEATURES, VERY RELIABLE, RECOMMENDED FOR READING BOOKS, SURFING THE WEB OR KIDS, CHEAPER THAN MOST KID TABLETS!"
Nice to have for the price I bought it for. Does what I need it to do just not very fast.
i bought his for my son and he loves it it fits right in his hands and easy to navigate
The fire tablet is a great tablet. I've purchased 2. The kids have shattered the screen on both and still work great!
I got this tablet for my grandson as a Christmas gift because of the timed parental control feature.
Bought this as an extra tablet for travel & shopping..it is perfect for what I needed smaller than my other tablet but functions almost as well.
My kids love it & I like it 2 tanks and is really easy to use great product..
"This is just the right size and price for my kids. For just playing the games, watching netflix, or just cruising the net, this is a great value."
Bought it for myself and then bought two more for my kids. They approved it :)
Bought for my wife as a replacement for a Fire purchased a few years ago. She likes this better

At an affordable rate. I am thrilled with the purchase fir my son

I have one but bought this for a gift. Best gift for a great price.
Fire tablets most most awesome with lots of good images
"Can't expect too much at $33.33, out of the box it has pixel damage. Already have it set up too much of hassle to return or exchange now."
"This is a great starter tablet for the price - It is easy to use, expandable and cheap and able to use for surfing and reading and games"
This tablet is a great purchase for the price. Easy to use and perfect for kids.
Bought it as a toy for my daughter to play games and watch videos.
"I got this for $33 on black friday. It was a great deal, but the ads are kind of annoying. Ads go away after you turn the tablet on, but it is a bit distracting at times. However, it is a small price to pay for such a nice tablet. It is a nice little device to keep on hand for web browsing and watching Netflix before bed."
"This tablet works well and provides basic app service. It does a great job for what it is intended for,"
This tablet is a great tablet for the average user. It has decent sound quality and works great as a reader
"If you are looking for something inexpensive for your kids this Christmas, this is the one.Easy to operate, good quality and size for kids and adults."
"Purchased this for my granddaughter, she is 13 and loves it"
Wife had a paper white but needed something to listen to her scribd account. I paid $33 for this thing.. worth do much more.
Got a great item for a great price. I'm totally in love with this item. Well worth the price.
I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.
"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss. I'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. Not wasting money on it."
she loves it. very good product for the money. would recommend it to friends.
I purchased a Galaxy phone and received the Fire tablet for free. I do use it to read books to my son. He mostly uses it to play his games. It does the job!
Mostly use the Kindle fire to read eBooks. Works great to download and read books from the public library.
Good price for the tablet. I brought this for my nephew
amazon kindle fire 7 inch is a super buy . works great .
Great buy. Deff worth the money. Much faster than my phone
Perfect for my now 5 year old alittle off setting up since use to an iPad but she's doing great with it
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece. Very good price.
Perfect tablet for the money and quality. I had to buy another as a Christmas gift
"Recently bought one of the 8GB models for myself and loved it. The next day, I ordered one for my wife and one for our kids. Easy to use, good battery life and a great price!"
"Bought 2 during Black Friday, great for the price! Don't expect it to be an iPad but for regular use and price, you can't beat it!"
Good tablet for basic used. Just need it for basic functions. Perfect
"It's great, but not too much memory. Bonus I was told that I could add a memory stick. Haven't done it yet, but like the possibility."
The product is cheaper than the kid version but works the same. It is a great product from Amazon. The camera is so so but entertaining the kids are great.
"Great tablet for kids to play games, school apps and reading"
Bought this for my mom and she just loves it. Uses it for reading mostly.
Bought as a gift for a disabled relative. She loves it.
This is a good tablet for the kids. They love watching youtube and playing apps.

"great gift have one myself, easy to use & carry!!!"
My kids adore their tablets! Best purchase ever!!!
We purchased 3 of these for our kids and they love them.
This tablet does exactly what it says it's going to do. Got it on Black Friday for $33. It's hard to believe that they can sell something like this for $50 and make money. Works great. Easy to use. Lots of free book from Amazon
My nephews use their tablet all the time. It's durable and pretty fast. They love it.
Haven't try used it. It a Christmas present. Updated you later
"I purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing, and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use, I set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use."
Small and easy to use. This was a great value on black Friday.
"I bought it for my daughters gift, she loves playing"
"Myself and my two kids have these tablets. The do exactly what I need them for, to read and watch streaming shows. They have games for my kids and they are cheap so if they break them I'm not to worried."
"Good size, Easy to set up and use for my grandkids"
"I purchased two of these tablets, for my 10 and 11 year old daughters. They work great! Very good deal for the price."
got this for my nephew and he loves it. easy to use and has great sounds and picture quality
"I absolutely love my Amazon Fire. When I travel I always have access to my book, emails, and the internet all in a nice little unit that fits in my purse. You can enlarge the print to make it easier to read. Very happy and you sure can't beat the price!"
"I love this little kindle. It's necessary to take advantage of your Amazon Prime membership. With that membership, you get to read, every month, one their amazon unlimited kindle books. To take advantage of that aspect of your prime membership, you have to read these books on your kindle, and can't be accessed on other android tablets. That's 12 books to read for free a year. Best of all, mine was on sale for $39.99."
"Excelent for reading, and for the kids. Own two of these, and they both work perfectly."
Not impressed but don't regret it. I like the parent controls a lot though - main reason I got it.
What a deal I got this Black Friday specially for a kid who loves reading
Ny son really enjoys playing his games on his tablet. It was good purchase at a awesome price.
As a gift you can't go wrong. Best price an happy customer
"Purchased this for my Mom who had never had a tablet/smartphone, etc. She was able to figure it out quickly and the price was right. Works great for her."
"Until the tablet stopped being responsive, I spent many hours enjoying casino games. I used the tablet primarily for gaming but also I was able to get news on occasion.I bought the tablet because my laptop had ceased to function. If I don't get a new laptop, I will most likely get another tablet, perhaps an upgrade."
Best tablet buy for my son . It's perfect for the games he plays
Very good product at a very good price. I bought this product as an affordable table option for my son.
Great for reading books and the kids app is great. My 5 year old loves it
"Nice product, great value. Perfect beginner tablet for my 7 year old!"
This is such a great tablet for the price! Only regret was that I didn't buy another one for the Black Friday sale price
Great for kids of people who don't need lots of memory
"Bought for my nieces, great for them and easy to learn to use"
"Easy to use, battery life could be better, but does what's needed"
It was a good price and nice. It takes nice pictures.
I actually purchased this tablet on Black Friday 2015 for my son. It works great with no problems. I bought 2 more as gifts for my nephews on Black Friday 2016. Plenty of green games to download. Great for kids !!
"This tablet is a great gift, specially if you have lil ones. They will be entertained for hours."
Great for kids. Easy to use. Great price. Would recommend.
Played with a little but it's a Christmas gift. No problems with so far
Bought this as a gift for my niece. Hope she likes it
Easy to navigate. Great for kids and adults. Parental control features. Love a tablet and EReader in one!
"Great Tablet, good value for money. I got this as xmas gift for my famaily."
We bought several for our employee party. I liked it so much I bought one for myself.
Great easy to use great pictures great price. Awesome
"I'm not a huge fan of the modified Android interface on this tablet, and it is FAR from the best tablet on the market. Not even close. But I am giving it 5 stars based on its value. It is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera AND a microSD slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. Throw in the excellent integration with the Amazon ecosystem (if you use that) and you have a very worthwhile device. If you are not a big Amazon user, I don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultra-low-budget tablet."
"Great tablet, perfect for my son. He can have all his games. Great performance"
"I've had my tablets since last year and they still in great condition, ii read on it a lot so I think I made a good choice"
Never knew I needed a tablet until I got my hands on this one
"Outstanding value, for the price I paid on Black Friday ($33), this tablet does all of the functions I use my expensive iPad for (light web browsing, email, videos, books).Sure its not as fast and the display isn't as sharp, but its less than 10% of the price of an iPad 2."
It gets the job done and I like it. It's really good for little kids as well
Perfect e reader for beginners. My daughter is 9 and loves it
great tablet works well was a good gift for a begiiner
First of all you cant beat the price. I got it for my 4yr old granddaughter and it serves its purpose well. Its perfect for her to play games on or watch you tube vidios. Its size makes it easy to take it with us almost everywhere because it fits rite in my purse.
The tablet is not bad at all for the price I paid during Black Friday. The only issue for me is the occasional pausing during streaming on netflix
Good for the price. A very basic tablet with basic functionality
Nice and convenient tablet for kids! I like that it has parental control so parents can Connell what the kids do and download on it. Only downfall is you can't get all apps on these
"I have purchased numerous kindles and Fire tablets for family and friends. They've all loved them. When they went on sale at Christmas, I decided it was time to get myself one, after, of course, buying three for unsuspecting niece and nephews. I have an older iPad that I love and use but it is limited due to upgraded technology. This Fire tablet is perfect to do all the things I could not do elsewhere. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you owe it to yourself to get one of these things."
Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.
Great price for this tablet my kids love it and we haven't had any problems with it.
Works very well as a cheap youtube tablet. Would recommend.
This is a great tablet for my gra ds kids Christmas presents
I bought this kindle as an upgrade for my first kindle fire
Great unit at a great price for reading and storing recipes and cooking.
An Amazon fire tablet for $50!? Need I say more. Worth every penny.
"Wife loves it, great price. She thinks it is better than our sons ipad."
"awesome little tablet with lots of functionality. my biggest complaint is the lack of power in the volume. besides that, there are too many apps on the home screen that gets in the way and looks cluttered. i have not found a simple way to remove them yet."
"glad I got this kindle. can take it with me, and I can actually see the screen"
A real nice tablet for children and got it on sale at Bestbuy
My son loves this tablet and it was an amazing Black Friday deal!
"The size is nice for portability, roughly the size of a normal paperback, nice features, very easy to use, adding books to it is a very easy procedure, either downloading or hooking it up to the computer to transfer .pdfs, etc."
Got this for the tanks giving and found it to be a good one for my daughter. The battery life is pity good for this device and the device itself is robust as my daughter uses this tablet very roughly.
Best investment made. I use this daily for reading and doing light work.
Does everything my daughter needs to do as far as playing games
Awesome product we enjoyed a lot very easy to use with no problems
I would definitely recommend this product for the price.
for 50 this one of the better tablets you can get as its fairly fast and has a solid display.
Easy to use many different features make it fun to use
Easy to use in kids mode. Lots of games and books for the kids
"The Amazon Fire is very versatile. Affordable, and can side-mount the Google Play Store."
"My niece loves this tablet & I love the Amazon add on that lets me control what she can do, how long she has per day, and when it turns off for the night/ turns on in the morning."
Easy to use. Great size. Great price. Easy to navigate.
Works well for the purpose of reading and a few games.
"This is another standard Kindle color screen product that replaced our original Kindle 7"". This one is much faster and has more access to apps, although they are all through the kindle store, not android app store. I couldn't for example use my Mcafee anti-virus. I had to use the one that Amazon approved. Over all, a very good upgrade."
It's for my kids so I didn't want to spend to much but they down load all the games they want and keeps them busy
Very useful and helpful techs at Best Buy. Cost was average
i bought it as a replacement for my son's tablet that got broken. he likes to watch kids youtube app in the evening when we are winding down but with amazon you cant get any youtube apps just some terrible knock offs which was the point for getting to begin with. the orice was great though!
My Kindle Fire is much better than my previous Kindle. Works well in bright day light and user friendly. Access to books and downloading is more streamlined with this device. I'd not hesitate to buy again for myself or as a gift.
Bought this as a gift. My kids and I have these at home and love them. My cousin loves it as much as we do.
"This is my second Kindle Fire. Although the first one still works, I wanted an updated one. It is the perfect size for purse or pocket and does everything I need, even things not available on my iPad. Each version has some changes and that got some getting used to."
"Very good quality price ratio!We buy this table for a little kid for a very low price and it's one of best deal for a very long time....Again, very good for their low price."
I purchased this for my son and he loves it. He does vary basic things like play games and watch videos but it works perfect for that
"I love it, it is easy to read on and a nice size screen for the kids to watch movies on"
Looking forward to using my updated Kindle at Christmas.
"Use it everyday..never had a problem,perfect for gaming ,internet,email,etc.i use it for everything.priced nice"
"For 48"" the price paid was excellent. The only con is that it isn't a smart tv. But it is 1080 HD. Would recommend."
"Love the tablet, easy to use and loaded with fun for the whole family"
Bought as a Christmas Gift. I think my grand daughter will be very please.
My kids loves this tablet. They watch YouTube and play games on it all day.
Can't beat the price on this tablet. Have to a student in college and they love it for taking notes and movies.
"Great price, works well for what i needed. No need to spend hundreds on other tablets."
"I was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so I needed something that I could check email and writer posts on. Now I mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. With all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. The tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. So if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, I think this is a good bet."
I bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. Not much storage and the cord strips easily.
"Bought this for my kid, easy to use. Set up parental controls so they don't shop on Amazon, and it's quick."
I think it's a great tablet and it's great for the price
Great for grandkids. Have times they can go on. I have 4 of them.
This tablet was great for my boys. I would highly recommend for young kids. A+++
"The value of this device is amazing​, the battery life could use some work tho"
It's a nice tablet that has lots of apps from the Amazon market and if you're an Amazon Prime member you get a lot more videos/music/etc. to enjoy as well.
I especially like it's versatility and ease of use.
I bought this tablet because of the great price and all the things that it can do. Really excels in all fields.
My kids love their new tablets they use them for homework and at school
Inexpensive alternative to standard Kindle e-readers.
I would definitely recommend. It's great for every day use.
Bought it for my 4 yr old nephew who loves it. Easy to use.
The price and product is perfect. Great for travel. Light weight and easy to use.
"Love my tablet. Only thing I wish, is that the charging cord was longer."
"This is indeed a great product. Touch sensitivity and overall performance offcourse cannot beat other top brands, but it is with a very good price."
"My 4 year old doesn't like the tablet for several reasons.. I can't say why, but she just doesn't like it. So, I'm going to have to get another tablet."
I started out looking for an iPhone 7 Plus. My company wanted my iPhone 7 and $400. I looked into tablets and found this wonderfully sized Kindle. It does everything a phone or a tablet does for a fraction of the money. I love mine.
This is an absolute steal at the price! Great product with great functionality!
Great tablets I bought two of these for a 5 yr and 6 yr the parental control is an awesome feature. No regrets whatsoever.
Very good tablet for very little money. Kids love it and it is very durable.
A good enough tablet with great features and very decent screen quality.
Perfect for kids with the child profile. Only downside is the limited space
bought for my 7 year old it has held up to her expectations which at times might be higher than mine as kids show far less patience.
Very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability.
I bought this item for my granddaughter she is twelve years old and very tough on electronic devices she has dropped an misplaced electronic items before so for the price I was very satisfied
bought this product online and less than an hour i was able to pick the product in store. super love it!
This table was use for watching YouTube and it's perfect with awesome stunning picture quality comparing to all other expensive ones. This is very affordable.
ok product serves the purpose nothing more than that
Great device. I purchased this for my uncle. I have the same device and it works great for our needs. I use it mainly for games and reading.
Love it I download all of my audiobooks on my tablet
Didn't work more that 4 months. Don't waste your money.
"I purchased this item on sale as an alternative tab to android RC tablet. Fire tab is extremely slow, my son had been using RC tablet without any problem, but this one is slow, takes forever the web page to load, apps are also slow. Absolutely waste of money."
"I had one, it was a gift. When it broke down I wanted another one. So I bought this one."
It's a great tablet we use it alot when we travel .
"I love this tablet, I can take pictures and videos."
Pretty good tablet. Keeps the kids interested which is Why I brought it.
I like it kids like it definitely needs a case so 4 stars 5 if it had case
"My daughter loves it,she gets to play her educational games"
"This was an affordable device that allowed me to play music while at work. It also does quite a bit more, but this was my use of the product. It was less expensive than the iPod."
Bought this for my son to get him reading more and he loves it.
I love how much this tablet can do. It fits in my purse perfectly.
You get what you pay for. It works but is very slow.
I will never buy this again very cheap not with a dime
The Amazon Fire is a perfect buy and at a great price! What my son loves best about the Fire is that it has a camera (the older version does not). I would highly recommend this the Fire!
"Use for facebook, games, booksDoes a great job - easy to use"
Best product ever my kids love them dearly!!!!!!!!
"Use it daily home and on the road, my husband is hooked on it as well"
"Fire is a great little tablet that is easy to use. Great for reading books, checking your e-mails, doing Facebook."
This is my 3rd kindle and my last-i'm moving on to something better!For me -following all packaging insert guidelines-they only lasted a year at the most.
"Took my daughter a little while to get used, now I have to pry it from her hands very pleased this item"
"My 15 year daughter love her gift, even when the apps are limited its good for the affordable price."
"It turned out to be a good product. Glad I bought it, came in handy for school."
"I use this for time tracking, music and inventory control in our woodworking shop. Works great, easy setup and no complaints."
"This tablet is great for my son. It's easy for him to access and download apps, play music and enjoy video racing games. Great value for the price!!!"
This has all I need and want. Great storage and speed.
Kids love it can downloead lots of games great charge system
Was looking the a base tablet for reading and videos on the go. This more than what I was expecting at this price point.
The Amazon Fire Tablet is great for the price. Great stuffing stockers.
Best has some of the best products! They are very helpful in finding products! This tablet works great for reading books or watching movies!
"Works for a child. It's a good tablet, I guess my complaint would be the charging port. Not very stable."
I purchased 3 of these Kindle's for my grandchildren and 1 for my husband for Christmas! They loved them and they were a very good price! I then bought myself one!
Awesome product! Can do so much with my Kindle! Love it
"This is a good product if all you want to do is read emails and do some internet browsing. It does not compare to an iPad or a higher level Android tablet. For this price, I believe it is a good purchase for basic usage."
Nice tablet for a very affordable price. I would recommend to anyone!
My wife uses this to watch our diabetic 5 year olds sugar levels through the website we have set up
I love that I combines a tablet and a reader!! I don't need to bring two products around! Tough to beat at a $49 price
I have bought this tablet for my other 2 grandaughters and it works fine for them! This one is for the 5 year old ! The other 2 are 7 and 3 years old! Great parental control features!
"my niece love it, of course her older and wild siblings like taking it from her but overall she say she love it."
This is a great product for kids. User friendly lots of capabilities.
"She loves it, its her first tablet experience and tells me all the time how much she enjoys using it. She couldn't be happier."
I like this tablet for kids because it's easy for them to use and also allows for parental controls to help keep them safe. Great value too.
Great for kids with parental features or they would download apps likes crazy
HAVENT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. GREAT TABLET . !!
I purchased three of these Tablets for gifts for three young children. Should have bought one for myself. Grafics are more than I could have imagined.Great for learning and playing games!!
Very easy to use. Great multiple uses for such a low price. I truly enjoy this and I use each day more than my desktop computer.
This is so affordable and we use it everyday! Our kids use it to watch kid videos on prime and kid apps. We bought a super tough case for it and it has lasted a long time.
I enjoy this tablet. Since I am an Amazon customer it was fairly easy to set up once I entered my amazon ID.
Bought for one of my granddaughters. It was easy for me to get setup and off she went. Kids are too smart these days.
It's been prefect for my daughter to use for Netflix!
This small tablet packs a lot of power. I can use it for many tasks including checking email and paying bills.
not only s it a great product but the sales staff especially mike Whitt tremendously patient and skilled in showing me the basics of the device!
"We had one before and it was stolen so we got another and loving it as always, great thing to have on the go or when you don't want a bunch of books all over"
I love all of my Amazon products and this one is no different. Great quality and clear pictures
We purchased this for our son (9) and it works great for him.
Got this for my granddaughter after her other one was dropped and cracked. She loves that she can watch all her YouTube videos on it!
I purchased this for my mother in law. She is getting old and wanted something she could see.The font size was never quite right for her and she was often confused by all the attempts this device makes to sell you something. It really wasn't a good fit for her.The device died approximately 1 week after purchase. We returned it for a refund.
Purchases as a gift for my niece in the Caribbean. As soon as I gave it to them they hooked it up ti the wifi and was ready to go. They enjoyed every minute of it
Great for kids inexpensive wouldn't mind buying again
Loved the amazon fire tablet. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4yo. I bought a case too because as you know kids tend do drop things... this tab was awesome because it linked up with my amazon account and I had control on what my child was viewing. I liked that the price was great and the product is durable. My son thinks it's awesome.
"My family has been enjoying Amazon stuff more lately, and the Kindle Fire Tablet is no exception! I haven't spent enough time on it to get what I need as efficiently as I can on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his Galaxy tab 8 (currently in use by our 10-yr-old son). Remotes are too complicated sometimes... our family joke anyway... but he'll sit down and browse the Amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and I haven't heard a complaint or call for help. I haven't even heard any annoyed-caveman sounds! I like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. May sound trivial, but my main complaint with both Galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged (bottom-portrait for the tab 8 and bottom-landscape for the tab 10.1 - either way, it hinders function). Functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the Fire tablet. When I'm ready for a new tablet, I'll probably get the Galaxy Pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the Kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated. Price-point is great too."
You can keep watching your movie on the go if you have to leave the house.
Watch amazon prime and netflix on it for cheap. What else do you need from a tablet that costs under $50.
"Died after 120 days....30 days out of warranty. Some no name brand lasted us 3 years before this one. Figured we would get a ""name brand"" thinking that it will last longer. I won't be purchasing Kindle/Amazon products anymore."
Wanted to give my father another way to read his books or play his games without lugging around his laptop. He hasn't put it down since he was given it for Christmas. Easy to use and has a lot of options available for apps.
Great table. In fact t am typing this review with it now
Good size for my toddler and resolution is very good.
"This is a great starter tablet. Does all the basic things and is only $50. Not gonna find a better one for this price. In this price range your not gonna find a faster one. Get an SD card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet, only 8 gig of memory."
It's a little slow on some things but otherwise I really like the tablet.
"Bought this to use to read my textbook on trips when I didn't want to carry my laptop. Fits what I needed perfectly. Lightweight, and the battery is lasting a long time. Easy to set up."
Extremely sturdy construction. This is a great tablet and very durable. It can take a fall and keep working as if nothing happened. I would recommend this for someone who has a special needs child. I would definitely buy another one.
My son loves it he downloads games and music... he watches movies on it he loves it.
"It's easy to use and so much fun! I like that its small, portable and has so much I can do!"
My daughter loves it! She spends hours upon hours on it!
I bought 6 of these for christmas for my nieces and nephews. Best gift for the price. they love them for the online and app games.
"The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless."
Kids loved it would buy again good storage works well
It's a great tablet for my nine year old. She does her homework on it.
I only had a chance to download one movie and I was impressed with clarity of pic
Grabbed this tablet for my daughter for her birthday she loves it
I love this!! Wish it had more Apps. But great for the price.
Perfect item for our autistic grandson. He absolutely loves it.
"Purchased this tablet to use as a control panel for Action Tiles.It is a decent tablet for its really low price. Side loaded Google Play store and utilizing Kiosk Browser, I have Action Tiles displaying my Home status as to security, controls and Sonos speakers.Would recommend this tablet for this use and anyone wanting a bare bones tablet."
Great value for price. Can add a 64gb card for almost unlimited storeage. Can download video & audio to play offline.
I Brought this item for grandsons. They love them.
My daughter loves it. She's a little rough with and throws it sometimes but it's still good. I did have a soft case on it though.
Bought this for my son for Learning and fun we take it everywhere with us works great
I love this tablet so much that I bought 7 of then for my family so they can have there
"You aren't going to find a better tablet for this price. Loading non-amazon apps can be a pain and the OS is not the best, but it's great for games and reading."
Bought this tablet for my 7 year old. It doesn't have the best amount of memory but it does have a spot for a mini SD card. It's pretty durable and easy to use.
Silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. Had to install Mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. I can't put in orders with Silk (the default Fire browser). If using Silk make sure to disable the caching to Amazons servers. With caching on the browser is almost unusable.Ads are really annoying (only come on when you first turn it on) but I don't even really notice what they are. Usually things I'd never purchase like makeup (I'm a guy) or other junk. These make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. This is not a quality device like a Galaxy Tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.
"I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!"
i was very impressed with my Amazon Fire 7 Tablet - very good!!!!
"He loves it, I love it. It was the perfect birthday gift for him. He has lots of games to play,and its perfect for my reading."
"I purchased this tablet as a gift for my mother. It doesn't have the drills of some other tablets, but it meets the basic needs she was looking for."
Love the Kindle. Easy to travel with and can be used as a tablet or reader.
Does everything we expected! Great for the price. Had it over a month now and no problems. I'd recommend it!
"Disposable tablet, almost like a burner phone. Works ok, but need SD card, very little space."
Purchased for my 5 year old son and he loves it to
My son's love these things. Great price and works for me.
I love the Tablet. It was for a gift but I have purchased a few of them..
"You really can't get much better bang for your buck! Great Device, a must have"
"Easy to use, light, sturdy. Purchased case on ebay. Great price. Wish it would work with chromecast. Sketchy Fios updates but resolved."
Easy to use for kids and elders. Very Basic functions.
Should of did a little more research. Do not like the ads on the start screen.
Works perfect and the price is right for my needs.
I bought both of my young boys one tablet each. They absolutely love their tablets and very easy to use. Rarely do I hear arguing while they play their games whether it be letters and numbers or racing.
"For the price you cannot beat the deal on a tablet. Crystal clear picture and very fast. OK, so the wide variety of apps available on an apple or Android are not here. But most major apps are, and if the app is not available just go to their website. A simple fix."
I am so glad i got this tablet i can take it with me anywhere and use anytime
"2nd kindle liked the first one better space bar located to close to change menu icons download is slow and have great internet service, device freezes up a lot and have to shut down and reboot, must close out any open tab to open a new one one happy with this model"
It works like expected. The photos are not as good as my cell phone but ok enough for the price
Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.
"Durable and inexpensive. Just bought two to replace my kids' fires that were over 4 and 2 years old, respectively."
Perfect tablet for my son. No complaints. Super fast shipping!
"For the money, a great Android like tablet that works"
I bought 6 of these 4 for my children & 1 for me and my husband. Very easy to set up and for the money they are the best buy in tablets. My kids use them to do their homework as well as play games; great parent control options.
Great for an inexpensive tablet for around the house.
"For the price you can't beat it , bought 4 as stocking stuffers 2 years ago, besides the one that went swimming in the bath all are still working as should"
"I use this Amazon Kindle for Web browsing & social media. Convenient for traveling, but camera sucks so use your phone for pictures."
Good for reading and surfing on the web good for games.
"Got this on Black Friday and wasn't I would use it much but I do, excellent value, easy to use."
I have this tablet and loved it so much I gave one as a gift. Battery life is long.
"great product, we are loving it, highly recommended"
Wish I didn't have to sign on with a card but great product
"I purchased this simply for reading kindle books. I was able to get it with a reward certificate for $40. It's biggest issue is glare, more so in the sunlight. I bought an anti-glare screen protector and it made a huge difference, but it is still difficult to read in the sun. I'm still very happy with the product."
Great tablet. Very reliable. Only problem was the ads. But they didn't bother me too much. Overall a great buy.
Good for reading novels.Also watching diy videos.
I bought for my son to play with. He enjoys it a lot.
Great product especially for the price! It exceeds my expectations and then some.
"Awesome and very cheap, but would recommend!!! Awwwwwwww"
Enjoy portability of this product. Great price too.
Perfect for my wife for her games; keeps them off her phone and much easier to work with ....
This device was easy to use. It was as it was described.
"Great tablet for the price if you are a user of Amazon's services. Plays movies, videos , music from Amazon's Prime service great. If you don't use these, it is an OK android tablet. Does not support the Google Play Store directly but can be sideloaded. Not a great experience tho."
We got this for our daughter before an overseas trip. She got a few books and loved it. It has worked well for her.
"Bought this kindle mainly for my kids. There are plenty of games that my kids, and I, enjoy playing. Having the expandable memory slot was one of the reasons I purchased this model. Happy with my purchase....we have three of this model."
Its very good tablet for the price. I have owned previous versions
I got it because it's my mom's favorite color. It's got some powerful speakers. I can hear her on it from two rooms away
Mostly use the Fire on the bus ride to/from work for You-tube/g-mail and Face-booking and it functions very well for thise uses and constanrly keeps up with the wi-fi when i switch buses Sometimes I have to reconnnet but mostly not ! I have to charge mine about once a week and usually give it a top-off of juice over the weekend. Battery life might be an issue if I ran mine more intensly but works for me. Does alot of stuff I've really only scratched the surface of what it can do.
My son loves his tablet it keeps him occupied and well behaved
"My grand daughter loves it, hasn't put it down since we bought it from her. Clear picture, runs great, she loves to watch videos and play music."
I love the kindles fires and all Amazon echos have bought for other family members highly recommend
Great tablet that can be used for kiddos and those not great with technology.
Happy i used for play games is ver y fast At camera
Easy to use and download books. Great for beginners who never used digital book readers. I love it!
It's a good tablet for the price although battery is not the best
"I was looking for a tablet that I could download movies on for my toddler to watch on long car rides. This Kindle Fire has great parental settings so I don't have to worry about my child accidentally buying things or seeing inappropriate content. This runs much cleaner and faster than older generation Fires. I was a little taken back by the size since I have a much bigger one, but It'll work out great for what I wanted it for. I did notice I have 2 burnt out pixels, but they don't bother me enough to return or exchange."
I got this for a friend an was very pleased. The fire tablet is awesome. It dose everything the kindle fire dose.
"Tablet itself is good, I mostly use it to read on the go. However, this tablet only works with Amazon approved apps. As long as you don't mind it, this is a good choice. Get it on sale for a better price"
Light weight easy to take with u . From reading to Facebook for all your little needs
Good entry level reader that is easy to use. The resolution is great for that page turning novel. Has lots of other bonuses too.
"The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!"
"Excellent for travel, games, email, small enough to carry"
so much better than my 3 year Fire for versatility.
Our first one was defective but was replaced by Amazon. Our replacement works great.
"I got mine for a month, and I mainly use it to read PDF documents from SD card or OneDrive. The tablet is nothing like the reviews said. It FREEZES up every time I press ""Home"" or go to the next page or even to close out. When I go on the internet, some pages do not load fully. 9/10 times only the 1st half of the page was loaded. I am very disappointed."
"Fire , it does the job I wanted it to and that is to entertain my kid and myself. Nothing fancy and it does have it's quirks and bugs. Sometimes can be frustrating on response time with touch screen and loading."
got this as a gift for the wife. she loves it and uses it a lot.
Amazon fire is perfect for kids and other teens. Its not that expensive compared to ipad while the quality of product is pretty good.
"My daughter is away at school, and she uses this inexpensive Amazon tablet, which she won't is should something happen to it, and it'll be easy to replace. It has all the functions she needs, though it doesn't support some apps, but it does support all the popular social media and has a decent camera. It's easy to use, big enough to read on, but it's not huge, and it's easy to hold, store and carry. My daughter enjoys the orange cover."
Nephew loved to play games and listen to music. He never puts it down. Very good buy.
"For $50 this is a fine tablet, However I bought a 64gb SD card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it (for example Netflix). So be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage."
"The tablet is as you would expect at the price point, nothing too exciting in terms of the tech. But, add a Prime membership and this device really excels at giving you access to all the Prime perks and adds another voice control point for Alexa."
"Bought this for my son, and he ises it all the time."
You can't beat this for the price. The Internet is fast and a good reader.
Love this tablet because it's durable and versatile. Glad they finally added a memory expansion slot. Highly recommend!
"Simple to use, works very well, and at an unbeatable value for price."
"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Got it for $33..couldn't beat the price. We found this was a greal alternative to pricier tablets and clunkier items such as laptops and Chromebooks, when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing. Display is great, Definitely recommend"
We bought this for our son and he loves it. He can read his books and also play games on it.
"This is not the first time, I bought these tablet several times, because they work excellent, I sent one for my best friend and she love it, I like everything from this product."
Good economic solution for a tablet to surf the web when neeeded.
"Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. She loves it. Great for the kids, or if you're not looking for anything specific. Lightweight, easy on the eyes. You don't mind spending that money especially for a kid that may break it...because they're kids."
"At sub $50, the kindle fire pretty much falls under disposable. That said it is a fantastic little tablet, good enough to do almost anything you would want to do.Only downside is the mono speaker, it is a little of an issue when listening to music over the speakers. If wearing headphones, the sound quality is ok and you get stereo."
"The item that I needed was very good in value and easy to find in the store The cost was reasonable and exactly what I was looking for, which was what I needed for the new printer that I also purchased at Best Buy. thank you"
Great tablet! My fiancee uses it as an ereader for books she downloads from the library.
Very durable cover Takes the abuse that a 3 year old gives it
"Bought this to replace a previous tablet that died. Popped in a 16 GB micro SD card to add memory. You need more, 8 GB is not much. This tablet throws plenty of marketing at you, but in exchange you get a lot of functionality for not much money (I paid 40 plus tax). If you like intense gaming, you'll be disappointed I think, its not super powerful. True it cannot run Android apps, but its an Amazon product, so there are lots of apps out there. For my light weight needs, it works well."
Very compact and easy to use. I Just wish it had Google play store but amazon is still great.
It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.
I bought a tablet few months ago is very good quality I like it a lot for watching youtube videos and i bought 2 more tablets for a gift
Gave as a gift. Hope it is working as planned. Nice sale price.
"I actually bought this one for a friend as I already have one. She reads all the time, and I told her this is what she needed. I'm not even sure she has taken advantage of all the other options that come with it but she loves it for reading her books. She is an older lady so I help set it up for her and have not had to help her do anything else. She has been able to navigate thru it with no other help. Greatest gift I could have given her."
i am 61 years old and do not know a lot about tablets. i mainly play the games but it is great for that
My daughter loves it. She can make her videos and listen to her music.
"The first kindle I purchased only worked for a week. Thankfully, Best Buy did a full return. This one works like a charm! My kids love it!"
The person I bought this for loves it. She had another tablet that was actually more expensive but she couldn't load apps or anything to.
"Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it"
"I got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. It has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. He doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated."
"I researched about tablets and based on my interests I choose the Amazon Fire 7 tablet and protector, I wanted reading and games mostly."
Awesome for kids. Great for parents (peace and quiet) lol
This is good for the price battery is good quality of picture is ok
"I purchased my Amazon Fire to check my E-mails and play games on it. SinceI have been using it, I check my bank accounts, use for reading and getting answers for problems on the internet. I am a Happy Camper."
We bought this for the grandkids to use for school homework and it wotks very well. Easy for them to use.
at 49.00 it was the best price for a small touch panel
Great first computer for kids. Durable and easy to manipulate. Lots of fun and educational games for the kids.
"I have specific information that needs access to quickly, My Tablet has been Extremely proficient in helping me with my Requirements !"
You can't go wrong with this Kindle! It's a super price and a great Kindle! It's great for reading or surfing the net!
"I purchased this tablet as a Christmas present when they were having a sale. It's a good, basic tablet that does everything you could want a tablet to do (especially for the price I paid)."
"I don't really care about the built in Amazon apps. I use this tablet for Xfinity TV streaming and it works great. Since it's Amazon, I don't expect them to abandon updates like the cheap Chinese tablets. It's not speedy fast, but for the money it is hard to beat."
"Have bought these for myself, grandkids and daughter. Nice size to put in purse and easy to take with you in car. Lots of uses for this."
My 3 yr old granddaughter loves this item! PERFECT
"It is great for reading, but that's about it. There are ads that are quite annoying as well as the slow speed of the device."
"An OK product. Bought on Black Friday for $35, you get what you pay for. Runs slow at times, good for simple tasks."
Love my kindle! Highly recommended to anyone that reads regularly or travels. We use it for reading on the go and even to access Netflix and email on a device larger than a cell phone but smaller than a computer.
"Great price, used for my 6 year old daughter on a 12hr drive from texas. kept her busy. used mostly for games."
"On sale for my 3 year old and he loves it, mostly used for movies and games."
"This is an inexpensive kindle that works great. It is a little slow loading which can be annoying, but I do love it - especially because of the price."
This is a great beginner tablet for a small children. Definitely recommend this starter tablet.
give the tablets to my grandsons they love them and would buy them as gifts
"This was to replace an older fire tablet that was worn out.It was the right size for my wife to carry around,also it was much lower price than the original."
"can't connect to any router, hot spot. Returned and so did the sales clerk with theirs. enough said..."
Works well for the purpose it was used for not fancy but good quality tablet
Not the greatest small tablet and Amazon does have it locked down pretty well but it functions.
We wanted an inexpensive tablet for our 8 year old and this one is perfect. He can use it to read books and play games and it was very affordable.
"I bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price. However, it only lasted 6 months before the battery died and was not chargeable, regardless of troubLeshooting and what cord or outlet I used.Best Buy said they couldn't do anything but said Amazon could help me since it should be under warranty. I escalated multiple times with Amazon and they refused to help me each time. So save your $49.99 and put it towards a good product."
This was a very nice unit and easy to use for kids. Good value
Got one for my nephew... very easy setup and has a ton of games to download!
its a great device I bought it for my great niece and she loves it
"I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet."
Can't go wrong at 40 to 50 bucks.I also have the 8 inch and prefer the 7 in the hand.I bought the eight for the extra ram 2gb instead of 1 but haven't seen any differences in the 7 or 8 while using it
"So here was my dilemma, I could buy a cheap tablet from a no name manufacturer and suffer lag time, battery problems, software problems and all the things the bad reviews said or I could buy(on sale) an Amazon Fire Tablet and get a great screen, great battery life, Alexa, wifi, access to my Amazon Prime goodies and an easy to us OS..hmmmm, which way should I go? Needless to say, thrilled with my Fire tablet, use it all the time and wondering why anyone needs to spend more when this thing does so much for so little."
"I bought 3 of these tablets for my nieces and I was a little worried about the quality because they were cheap. The quality is great and my nieces love them for playing games, watching videos, movies etc. Turn out to be a great purchase."
Great tablet if you have an amazon prime account. Not able to download some apps that are current. works better if you stay with in amazon.
This thing is pretty awesome. It's lighter and thinner than my previous one. I am a fan.
Bought 2 of these for my kids to have something to play with and watch movies on while traveling. Bought a couple kid proof cases online and they are good to go. Well worth the cheap black Friday price.
This was purchased for my 7 year old son & he LOVES it!! Perfect sixe for him
It was great for my 73 year old mother.She uses it for the Bible.
I bought one specifically to play music videos in my car with the Bluetooth sinced to my stereo. It's awesome.
I really like this product. It's easier to read when I'm eating because I don't have to hold a book and turn the pages. Basically I have both hands to eat with and only need to tap the screen to turn the page. I will say though the battery seems to drain a lot faster when you are using the wifi and looking up books or just searching the web. That would be the only bad thing about it I would say. Other than that it is an awesome purchase
"I really wanted a ""value"" item to load & listen to audio books both while at home and on the road. This is PERFECT. So quick and easy to load books via an app or the free library app. Pleasantly surprised....such a great little ""reader'."
got it for my three year old and it's perfect for him
"Great Device! Quick, easy to use and a great value!"
"Yes it is heavy, bulky and the adds are annoying but for the price it is a great little tablet."
I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.
I bought this tablet for my 10 yo granddaughter and she loves it.
Spending money on the cheaper one with ads is worth it. The ad only pops up when you first turn it on and that's it. Have not had any issues with it in the few weeks we've had it.
My daughter wanted this product for herself. I got this unit based on the price and size.
Great easy to use tablet.... Grabbed it for my daughter and she cant get enough. Gets the job done ...
"Decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen."
Got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks
This is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.
"I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better."
I purchased this as a gift for my parents. It's easy for them to maneuver.
Bought this as a gift for someone but I haven't heard of any issues
"I love these tablets I have two, I would definitely recommend they are light weight and hold a battery for a long time, great for emails , surfing the web or just shopping im gonna buy another for sure you should by this product"
My daughter loves her tablet it works really good.
Reasonable price yet love it my kids loves itttttt
I bought this tablet for my goddaughter and it was definitely a great buy! Kid friendly and she has all the books and games she's interested in as well.
My daughter loves to read so we thought that a Fire would be a great option for her. She loves it. They are getting smaller as time goes on for sure but still just as durable. Great gift!
I use this tablet to read e-booksome and watch movies. The screen quality is great. The tablet is small enough to fit in my purse.
This is the perfect tablet for my 3 year old son. He loves it and it is easy for him to navigate. It is also easy for me to set up parental controls and give him access to certain apps.
It's a really good tablet for kids my kids love them
"I loved my tablet, it fits in my needs. It's fast and works perfectly for me."
I use this tablet for my daughter and I could only download YouTube Kids. Wished I would have purchased the one with more storage.
This tablet is very easy to set up. It is very easy to use.
"I love my 7"" Fire Kindle...it's great when I go to appointments I can play some games or just read while I wait...light weight too not lugging around a bigger Reader..."
"Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much."
MY STUDENTS ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT FOR LEARNING .
"This tablet is a great value. Tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. The 8GB is somewhat small, but adding an SD card has helped with storage. The lack of Google Play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding Aptoide, I was able to access many of the apps that are available in the Play store, but not Amazon."
Purchased on Black Friday Deal. 71 yr. old mom loves it and uses daily for reading.
Great purchase for the money! I really just use it for Facebook and games.
"It is what it is. Awesome and basic! If you use Amazon and you need a small tablet, then walaaa!"
"Bought this for a friend. It does the job (basic web and book reading) and at an affordable price. Nothing too fancy, but no problems."
"I like the tablet for basic use, but definitely enough for any kid"
Easy to use and lots of fun and very lite weight ..
Really inexpensive and does everything I need it to for my boys!
"My daughter was 27 and had never owned a tablet, she loved it!She uses it constantly"
"Great tablet, for kids and adults. Love it, it's my backup for paying bills etc."
Got my amazon fire table and love it. It's really easy to use .battery last long
"Perfect gift for my mom who loves to read. When the weather is bad, she can download books from the library without leaving the house!"
Each of my boys have their own Kindle Fire. They love them! They're easy to use and the micro SD card slot allows you to upgrade the space to add more movies and games. They're especially nice when the wife and I want to enjoy dinner out!
Purchased two of these as gifts for Christmas. No complaints.
My mothers kindle paper finally died so I bought her this. She loves it because she can do so much more than just read books on it. Great product.
Simple and easy to operate. Upgrade from another kindle.
Great for kids. I love that i can monitor my kids.
"You can convert this to a kid kindle, very durable. Quality is great for the price"
This tablet was purchased for my niece. It is at a great price point to do what we need...movies and games!
"Friendly user systen, easy to setup, good size to put in a bag"
Good products I would advise every one to get one it work great and easy to install
Overall - good quality for the cost. Ease of use; functionality is beneficial and allows for great entertainment.
Nice tablet and at a outstanding price. Still going strong..
The best gift for someone and you could download a lot of games
I previously owned the larger hd fire 8.9 kindle and loved it. I wanted a smaller tablet to fit in my purse so this was perfect. I love the color. It holds a ton of books and you can add a sd card for extra space.
"I have one that I love so that I purchased this to give as a gift, and the recipient loves it too!"
It was a great kindle fire! It functions well as a reading device and a tablet. Plays good audio books.
"I purchased this tablet for my nephew, and he loves it! It works great, and has everything he needs for not only reading but school work and entertainment!"

Got this for 40 bucks my daughter loves it .finally I get my phone back
Great birthday gift for a 9 year old. He has enjoyed this so much.
bought for my 4 year old daughter. plenty of apps and battery life is solid.
"Great tablet for the price. If you're looking for a cheap and easy to use tablet, this is the one."
I got a really good deal on the tablets. My kids love their tablets.
"I really do not understand why Amazon has moved to the 6 inch format. The 7 inch format was much better and the screen size fir most aps better. Although I have relatively small hands, this one fits into my hand much better than the smaller 6 inch. A great tablet."
Great tablet for kids! Easy to monitor kids activity and set parental controls.
Bought 2 for our grand kids Great price and very good graphics
Great for reading books onlineI would recommend to friends
"Love this tablet, have bought several for gifts because I love mine so much!"
This is a very nice tablet for a first time tablet owner. Reasonable price and able to expand memory with micro sd card
The Amazon Fire is a great device and for a great price! This new device now has a camera where as our older version did not!
Like the small size and convenience. Recharges quickly and is available when my Lenovo tab needs to be charged.
this product does exactly what I expected it to do.loved it so much I bought two!
its need amazon account for download any apps ............... ita really pain for me . i dont like it
Is great has a kids zone on it won't let them buy unless parents ok it.
What more can i say it works great and it's cheap.
Great for reading. Good starter device. Would recommend to someone else
Brought this item for my Mentally Challenged brother. He loves it.
I have no complaints what so ever. Great Item. recommended
This tablet works perfect for me reading books on it. I love the option to have the blue light disabled so I can read comfortably in the dark.
Awesome for the kids and a great price....does the same as an expensive one
Excellent for beginners. Or anyone that wants to start with a tablets.
It's very fast and has great picture and for the price you can't beat it
I wanted a reliable tablet for my 8 year old son. This one was recommended to me after another tablet had charging issues. This has functioned well since purchase.
My daughter preferred the ipad. The apps are a little complicated for her age she is 2.
For the price it is great and it is quick to search
Bought this just to have as a device to read my comixology account. Works perfectly for my needs!!
This is a great tablet if you don't plan or want to spend a lot of money for one.
"The Amazon Fire reminds me of a cheap older Android tablet from 5 years ago. The camera is horrible, the screen is full and I'd rather play with fire than to use the, Amazon Fire. Im returning ASAP!"
This is a good tablet for your everyday used!!!!!!
Bought for daughter taking American Lit class that requires alot of reading. She downloaded audio form and enjoys having those stories read to her while working out.
i would recommend this to others. i think it is great for someone who is just getting into electronics.
really good value for the price. Easy access to internet and operation.
"Product works like it should, not a fan of the adds when you start up."
bought for my kid and it works great. fast enough for movies
Bought the tablet for my son and he loves it. very affordable and worth the money.
I purchased this tablet for my grandfather to use. He likes to play casino games and read! This works great for it. He is even learning to use the camera!
"Got this tablet for a 6-year old. It has all the bells & whistles of the more expensive Kindles, but I don't get upset if it gets lost or broken."
This is a very good tablet for a first time user or a young child. The software is easy to use and the camera works great.
I purchased this to replace the Ereader I had. It has done that and so much more.
Great for my 6 year old son he loves it was an easy set up. and for my son being 6 he knows how to work it very well. great from kids.
Very happy with this product. Way more than I expected and you couldn't beat the price.
"I originally bought this because of frustration in using my IPad for several websites. So I decided to try the Fire tablet. Well it did get me to the websites that IOS on my IPad didn't. But I started to investigate it more thoroughly. I checked the manual and started to have more fun. The camera works great , and the apps are great! This was to be a secondary purchase but I am using it more and more."
I really like the tablet. It is very easy to work and the graphics are very good.
Amazons fire tab is amazing entry level tab. just go for it.
I did the preview about this tablet before I buy it. It is a good tablet for the price and it's not too heavy
Not many apps I'd use. Not as useful as I'd hoped.
Bought this for my mom. Surprisingly very capable and fast. Quad processor for the price? Unbelievable. User friendly.
Great take along and travel size. It exactly fits my needs.
"I like every thing about the tablet size , color, takes good picture's"
Purchased to have portable Alexa. Nice tablet for the money and recommend it.
"I bought three for my each of my grandchildren. They are 2,5,and 7. The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it."
"We were looking for an affordable, quality tablet - and this did the trick! We are Fire fans!"
"Nice little tablet for reading, Netflix takes a while to load if you want to watch it on it"
"I absolutely love my Kindle fire! I'm able to do everything on it; read, watch videos, play games, listen to music, shop, etc."
"I only use tablet for downloading books to read. Great for that, although sometimes loses place."
Like these tablets they were gifts. I bought it for someone in another country
We've purchased quite a few of these for our children and nephews and nieces. Works well has reading and games
"Don't let the summary fool you; the reason this is the third one is because of the quality! I've bought one for myself, one for my son-in-law, and I bought this as a replacement for my mother, who uses it to read books in her tiny apartment. The Kindle Fire is extremely user-friendly, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but reliable tablet."
It is agood tablet for beginner kids and great for the price
Great Tablet for the Price. It was on sale for $39. I was surprised by its quickness.
"This tablet serves its purpose as my primary reader and mini computer on the go. Size is good, picture is clear, and the volume isn't bad for media either. Thumbs up"
Bought this to use in the kitchen for just recipes and pinterest but have wound up using it for a regular tablet! Fast loading and easy to use. Since I already have an Amazon account I now have free Alexa and so many other benefits
"I bought this mostly to read the Walking Dead comics on and a book here and there. It works great for that. A slightly bigger screen would be better for the comics, but bigger screens don't come for under $50. I can't speak to quality of video streaming or anything, but it performs well for reading."
Great device to entertain the children while traveling
"Gets the job done nicely. It's as convenient as using a cell phone, but just a larger screen. Great for reading e books and catching up with shows on line."
Very slow to connect to internet even with a good connection and wifi set up that worked for other electronics.
"Purchased 2 of these to gift to my granddaughters, and they absolutely love them. It's just the right size for them to comfortable hold."
This is a smart buy! Wonderful for reading and watching movies. Perfect if you have Amazon Prime!
The device has several interesting applications for reading as well as completing necessary tasks for enhanced media.
We already own one of these. Purchased another for my mom. We all love it. Connects easily to the Echo and all other apps we normally use.
Kindle is awesome. Operates similar to iPad only much much cheaper.
Great for watching movies when traveling. Perfect for watching on an airplane.
I purchased this for my children (ages 2 to 10) and they all love it and use it with ease.
Was bought for my 8 yr old who loves it to pieces!
"As one would expect, this is fine for what it is. A $50 tablet. Better than other $50 tablets on the market. Quicker and more stable. If you're looking for a tablet for a child or for basic surfing and YouTube clip watching it's fine. Apps are limited compared to the google play store."
This tablet was plugged in all night and did not charge.No powerWhite elephant
I am Giving this tablet away to someone birthday sup.
It works great as advertised. I bought a Micro SD card upgrade and that works too.
"Had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. Had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. Lots of family suggested the Amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. Well set up was a disaster. I wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one Amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. So now my 7 yr old has an Amazon account. Also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. And then had to go into settings to put a parental block on in-app purchases. Too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. In not happy with this tablet . It automatically backs up photos and stuff to an iCloud. I don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. Also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. My other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. I will not be replacing his with this product."
Very nice....some of the apps were hard to open at first...but had to play around with....love it now! Would definitely buy more again.
"At this low price compared to competitors, it's a convenient solution for a variety of applications. I keep it in the living room as a controller, having loaded the Harmony app to control activities and devices via the Harmony hub."
Really enjoying using my Amazon Fire very easy to use so many different features and apps the graphics and the color on this tablet are so vivid and alive I bought this tablet on sale not really knowing nothing about Amazon Fire but I'm glad that I did!!!
Overall satisfying tablet. My wife loves it and uses it almost every day! Would recommend getting a case and screen protector.
I really love the kindle. Great for the price. And u can add a memory card for more storage.
Its good for going on the internet and doing minor things. Some of the pictures on the internet have been enlarged to look out of focus.
The Amazon fire tablet has alot of features im very pleased with it.
The Kindle Fire I purchased at Best Buy is awesome for people to read books online and search the web. It is one of a kind!
"I hadn't bought an ""updated"" Kindle in quite a few years, so as the battery on my old one wasn't holding a charge very long, and searching or downloading anything became a half-day event, I felt it was time. So, off I went and purchased the latest 7"" screen Kindle Fire, and holey moley what difference. This new one is incredibly fast, has a beautiful picture, amazing capacity (plus a SD slot for expansion), and a two-way camera to boot! I'm still learning all the new bells and whistles, but so far this has been great and looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship!"
"Great for my 5 year old, but battery only lasts 7 hours if it's not being used!"
Love my Amazon Fire tablet because it's not too small and not too big. It's just the right size. It's light weight and the resolution is very good. I recommend it highly.
The product is relatively inexpensive but the performance could be better.
It's very nice tablet my kids love it and i am very happy
Recommended by staff member when I asked for help. Love the size and ease of use. Just what I was looking for.
"the internet server SILK is not compatible with free wifi on southwest airlines and I bought it to use on the plane. also I cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane. so I don't really need it since I have a computer , iPhone and kindle at home."
I bought this for my grandmother and she can't put it down
I love this product it very great for my son. My son educational apps on here
I like the size! The screen is perfect for my online reading textbooks for school!
Got one for my kids and they love it! It was super easy to set what apps they could have access to and stream prime shows. Not a huge fan of the Amazon app store compared to my android phone.
"This tablet is your best deal for the money. Since it uses an adaptation of Andriod made by Amazon, it is technically possible to install Google Play app store without routing the device, if you read a bit online, making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight. Absolutely recommended."
Love Kindle! Thanks for creating this gem! Granddaughter loves it
"This is a great tablet with all the access you need. It has a decent resolution and can be used to play games, connect on social media, listen to music and watch movies."
I got these for my kids Christmas present and there perfect for them. They download their games on to them and play during road trips and also download learning apps from school so they can stay ahead.
Very versatile and can be great for kids & adults.
"Pros: Light, easy to set-up if you have an Amazon account, parental control, good use for little ones, excellent camera qualityCons: Touchscreen can be sensitive at times"
"Got this around black friday, for a great price, Been happy with it and will be buying my son one as well."
Tablet has been everything I expected it to be. Much better then the previous tablet I had.
Good tablet to share with a child as two accounts can be set up on the device and content can be controlled easily.
They make a great child proof cover and the battery life is descent so far
My grandson had an older Kendall and I bought him a new were one and he loves it and it's a wonderful device
bought this tablet for a first time user the price was right the quality was good
"This tablet is great especially for a child. Granddaughter is responsible but accidents do happen so I didn't want to buy her an iPad till I saw how she did with this. After playing with her fire and being able to download so many free games, she informed me that she does not need an iPad. Needless to say she is very happy and so am I. I like that I could buy the smaller gb one since you can add an sd card to it, to increase the storage. This is really a great purchase."
One of the worst purchases or investments you could make for technology.
Kindle fire is excellent device I personally have one as do all of my children at this point
My Grandchildren Love Their Tablets! They really really enjoy watching movies & playing games on their tablets.
Very good tablet for this price.Its very handy.......
Although a cheap tablet with amazon functionality it's a very slow one.
I love my Amazon Kindle Fire. It's so user friendly and the clairity of the screen is awesome
My niece loves her kindle tablet. She uses it all the time.
"Easy to navigate & get acquainted with. Charges fast, holds charge! Very pleased"
I've been back and forth about what Kindle to purchase next. I'm so glad I chose the Fire 7.
Good for the kids and it works for playing games and reading. Exactly what I needed it for. Very happy.
Bought for my little daughter and so far it's holding up good.
I bought this tablet as a gift for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and it's easy for her to use. We downloaded multiple games on it for her.
purchased for my daughter to read and she loves it.
I got this item as a gift for a coworker and she really seemed to like it. The price is very fair compared to other tablets.
"Can't complain for the price of it on sale it does what it should at the speed that is appropriate,"
Bought it for my nephew for an upgrade and he enjoyed it more.
"Great tablet for kids and beginners, I would recommend for anyone looking for an easy to use tablet."
"Got this tablet as a gift for my mom, who is 72 and is a little not used to high technology, so she uses this tablet mostly for Facebook and reading an e-book. Works fine, but if you are an user that likes high resolution screen, plenty of storage and fast processor, this is not your choice.Good streaming can be done though."
"Best tablet out ther for the price, expandability and speed"
My wife likes it. She reads a lot so she uses it all the time. Also likes to go online with it.
This is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight!
"I bought two of these for my two grandchildren, ages 8 and 10. They love them. They are able to read books and play games on them. They were a great Christmas gift. So much so, that I bought a third one for my son-in-law and he is thrilled with it. The small price made it great for gift giving."
My son loves it stays on it all day wish the battery would last longer
I have yet to use it as I do not know how. I need help!
Three of my children have 1 of these tablets each and really love it. Don't like that it doesn't have google chrome or PLAY store but a solid tablet for a great price.
store sales person was very helpful. price is always the bottom line.
It a great gadgets for the kids to stay busy reading and playing or even watching their shows
Great tablet I purchased 4 for my nephews!!!!!!!!!
I purchased this as a gift but was told by the person that I gave it to that they loved it!
"Great product works really well for the money, !!!"
Awesome Tablet for reading books. Very easy to use. Great value for the price.
I have purchased 5 in the last few months and have been pleased with the products
We bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it works great! We love how it can be set up for different users!
The best e-reader to use and handle. This is my 2nd one and will get another one in the future. Recommend this e-reader
bought this for my 3 year old to watch youtube and movies. it does the trick.. sometimes runs a little slow.
I brought the tablet for my 9 year old son it's great for the kids can play lots of games download apps get on you tube ect but I don't like the fact every now and then it makes this weird sound and the screen blanks out and I have to turn the tablet off in order for it to work again.
"Truly enjoyed it, meets customer needs great for games, reading and day to day usage"
Is a good table for kids to play with to watch videos and play some games with
Bought for my 8 yr old. They absolutely love it. Clear display and durable
Wanted to upgrade my Kindle and this one is perfect.
"Good Amazon product , good camera and amazing apps"
I purchased this tablet for my child for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He has also dropped it a few times and it hasn't cracked or anything.
"This Fire tablet is great -- does all I want it to Only down side, the battery only lasts a few hours and has to be recharged often. I like to read -- sometimes, while reading, have to stop and recharge. Otherwise, I love it!!"
Bought this for my 7 year old daughter. Great first tablet for a child.
"Bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . Didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. Does the job. Good price for this product. Bought a second one for my dad. Only downfall is I couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . Besides that, pretty happy with this tablet."
"I purchased this tablet on a discounted price as an alternative for RC tablet. The operating system is not good, very slow response, apps takes a lot of time to open. Many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire OS, so my little one has a difficult time handling it. After 2 months, I got him RC tablet."
My son had the original kindle fire. It was great! Simple to use. It finally bit the dust. I bought a new one. They made it way to complicated. It is going back. The power button won't turn off. The notification box won't stay off the screen & the apps wont run. They just keep loading.
"Great tablet for the money, especially after you put the Google Play store app on it(see xda forums for instructions on how)"
Gave this as a gift and they have thanked me numerous times for it! I've had one for many years and it's still working with no problems!
"For the money, this is a very good tablet. I bought this as a gift for my dad. He loves it, and he uses it everyday."
I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is everything I expected and more. Great price for a beginner tablet.
"My son loves this, uses it for internet access and listening to music."
Bought the tablet for my son and it works great love shopping at best buy for all of my electronic needs
"This is my second kindle & its lighter than the 1st, & nice to read my books on"
"Great tablet with an even better price. Very affordable, sleek and has camera."
"Easy to navigate, relatively durable, sweet little tablet!"
Good phone but my return visit the customer service was horrific
"Bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so I wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its $50 so its whatever"
"I bought this has a gift for my kids. They love their Amazon Fires. A few down sides with the internal memory and speakers. Pretty weak in these areas. The memory and speakers definitely could use some upgrading. Fortunately the device has a slot for memory cards and we can connect to a Bluetooth speaker. To get the maximum use of the device you need Amazon Prime. Compared to Netflix, Prime is very competitive."
the kids love it they learn something every day i'm happy i bought it
My eight year old granddaughter loves it. Did research and the best deal was at best buy.
I bought for my nephew who is 11 years old. He is very happy.
Got it as a Christmas gift for my Grandpa works a lot better than his computer so he can email
"I did not use more than internet, for that works perfect"
It was an affordable gift for my son and he enjoys it and finds it helps him in school.
It is a good tablet to have. The books are good...
"I purchased this after trying the Insignia 8"" tablet which unfortunately had a charging problem. The graphics on this tablet are OK, though the contrast is not as good as the Insignia's or other more expensive tabs.Integration with Amazon for reading is excellent. Tablet is responsive and speedy. Construction is sturdy and heavier than the Insignia. The Silk browser runs well for all the sites I visit."
"I love this tablet, and use it as an eReader mainly. I love how this is capable of reading my books to me (if they're compatible). My favorite feature for sure! Thay way I can listen while I'm cleaning the house and my kids love to listen to them too. It bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem. Tactically the screen is so nice, i love the feel. The Internet browser is a but clunky, so if thats your main desire.. This may not be the best. I feel it does well for my needs. I have found most apps to suit my needs on the amazon app store."
Love my tablet was going to by laptop but bought this instead cause this is cheaper
great value as a beginner's tablet for a young person.
I love the product and its easy to use would love to recommend it to friends
Bought this for my elderly aunt. Was able to customize it so that it would be very simple to use for games. Amazon customer service is amazing.
Got this as a gift for my girlfriend who has Amazon Prime and loves binge watching Netflix. It's an affordable and decent quality Netflix machine.
It hasnt given me any problems much better than the last one i purchased love amazon
for something so small it has enough processing power to do what it needs to for a travel reader. graphics are also decent for the size.
Great starter tablets. Got these for my grandsons. They love them
Bought for mom loves it dependable and tough enough..dropped 2 times and not a scratch great item
When I first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldn't turn back on
My son liked it its a great tablet for kids. I recommend it
Nice tablet for children - Works well as a gift for the price
I bought 3 for my grandchildren and they love their tablets
Bought this for our 6 year old to use instead of spending the big bucks on an Ipad. It has pretty much all the same apps and it is easy for him to navigate around. Parental controls prevent him from downloading anything above his age level.
"I bought this Kindle Fire for my daughter for Christmas, and she has completely enjoyed it. Build quality seems good, and I have been impressed with how Amazon has increased the functionality of its basic Kindle Fire over the iterations of this product (I also own a first generation Fire). It remains a very viable product and a joy to use."
good for the 7 year old grandson to use easy parental controls
I didn't review prior to purchase because I already have one
I brought 3 of them. 2 were gifts. We love them. Awesome price.
Bought for my 8 year Old Granddaughter. She loved it
Even with onky 8 gb it's pretty quick. Only issue is downloading the free webroot... its not compatible
"At $50 it's worth getting if you have Prime or just use Amazon a lot. At $40 (on sale right now) it's a bargain. There's only one thing about it that's somewhat of a drawback: not very good battery life. But keep it in an area with a strong wi-fi signal and use Airplane Mode when you don't need wi-fi, and you'll only have to charge it every night. Seriously--every night."
I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it.
Very nice tablet for the price and great for kids.
"This tablet is great. Not the best, but it was only$35!!!"
This tab is awesome. Easy to handle and carry anywhere because of its size. The price also very reasonable.
Mom really love it for Christmas. Easy for her to use.
Great. Works great for the kids to do their online homework.
I bought 2 of these on Black Friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life!!!! The screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. Apps are ok and to be honest I could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. I bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. It says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!
Bought for my nephew. He didn't know how to operate it. It is a little tricky. Would not recommend for a child
Kids absolutely loved this gift for christmas!!!!!
"Well, a good table for under $50 it's not bad. I ended getting the Toshiba 4k tv with built-in Chromecast so I need an inexpensive table so I wouldn't use my phone. Turns out that the tablet does have Play Store so i was unable to download Google Home. This tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet. you can also control how much time kids can spend on it. unfortunately it wasn't for since it didn't work for what i need."
Great for ppl that use Amazon and Amazon products. The price was great to.
A great E-reader that doubles as a tablet. This model even has an expandabel memory slot. Great price I bought 2 for gifts
"Got two for my kids for Christmas they have been great so far they hold a charge and there not slow. I bought two off brand tablets last year of lesser quality and they didn't last very long, These have been worth every penny. The only negative is that you will have to eventually expand the memory"
Works great. Love the size and light weight. Love it!
"This is a good tablet for what you pay for it. You can read books,play games and surf the web. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have bought one with more storage!"
Purchased for my younger children to do learning games. My last one purchased was for a 4 year old and she loves it. Very durable.
I like best by becouse they are aforedabul and cuvenet and easy to get to.
Love the kindle. Great for the price. I brought 3 of them.
I bought this for my son for Christmas and its perfect. My son gets to play his games with easy access to Amazon prime content.
We have several tablets and iPads in the house and this is one of my favorites
"Picked this up on the black Friday ad. $13 and it's one of the best readers I have in the house. I've got nook, iPad and Android devices which don't operate as good as this reader. But it only serves that purpose in my house."
"Gave this as a gift. The receiver loved it and uses it all the time. I personally have an older Kindle, and I was jealous of the updates and find it to be much more like a tablet than the older Kindle Fires."
Purchased tablet for 4 year old twin grandchildren. Also purchased the protective cover. Absolutely love it.
I bought this for my wife after she started having headaches from doing Facebook and email on her iPhone. The larger screen makes it easier for her to use for an extended period of time.
We bought two for grandkids and one for mother-in-law and both are happy with the product
They have come a long way since I purchased the first kindle Fire. It's a worthy successor and a very good tablet for the budget conscience person.
"Readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like camera(not very good), calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. I didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps I use the most on my cellphone. It is good for the price anyways..."
The tablet is good and great for younger kids free download
Easy to use and understand. It's a great purchase.
Bought this tablet so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop when traveling. Didn't think I'd use it at home but I find all sorts of thing to use it for there too. Sure my phone does some of those things but the bigger screen is easier.I also didn't think I'd use it as a reader but I slowly got hooked. For $40 it's a real bargain.
It is a good tablet for kids wish it would be a little better with games
My son loved it he was so happy when he opened it up
Great to replace internet 5 day weather forecaster that stopped working. Nice looking display & easy to use. Price was great !
"I was looking for something within reasoning and saw the ad for these. I purchased them for my two oldest grand-babies and they loved them. I not only enjoy the price that I paid for them, but I can honestly say that my grand-babies are to this day still enjoying them."
This is what we were looking for. Works great. It connects easily.
"I bought this for my 9 year old. It perfect for playing not to heavy games and for reading. The only down side is that not apps are available in the amazon App Store. Others than that not bad at all. Also side loading the no available apps don't work all the time. If your looking for something to surf the net and watch movies on, then this little table is perfect for you."
Enjoy all the features of the tablets from gaming to pictures. Battery life is good as well
Very good value for the money. The kids love them! Easy to set up and use.
Easy to use and put kpdi on it now I can watch movies whenever
This tablet is very kid friendly. It's easy for my daughter to operate.
It's a good little tablet. Not the fastest thing but good enough for 40 bucks can't complain.
Love it. Gave this one as a gift for my mom. She's having a time with it.
Very good for me put it in my purse or use it in bed love it.
It's great for streaming my shows and playing my games like candy crush
Got this tablet during the Holidays while on sale. Take it to work not so worried about it being stolen. And screen is tuff as heck.
Bought for adopted family for Christmas they were happy
"Needed somthing for sister who is always on the go, easily fits in her purse and she loves it."
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it for it's games and learning apps. As for navigating the app store it is not as easy as apple or android. But you get use to it.
Great if you don't care about the playstore for android it works fine to me
"Didn't spend a whole lot of cash on this, bought it as a gift for a child for Christmas. Has all the functionality that most other tablets have. Screen might not be as nice but for the money you can't really complain"
Love the kindle fire.This is the eighth in my family
I wanted to get my 12 month old a tablet to start with and this was a good pick.
"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire Tablets for my god-children for Christmas and they love them. The tablets go where ever they go! They play games on them, as well as play educational games to learn different skills needed for school.I love that Amazon made the Fire tablet kids proof and the screen isn't so fragile."
It's no iPad but you can't beat the price. Makes a nice gift.
This was a inexpensive replacement for a device that was damaged by my kids. Would continue to purchase if needed. Great for kids 5-6 years old.
Tablet is ok I just prefere Android products. I dont Like the fire just being tied to Amazon accounts and loaded with all their exclusive content. But its a cheap quality tablet
This is the second Amazon fire 7 tablet I've purchased. I haven't seen anything that compares to it for the price
"I like this tablet very much. Good for kids to use and cost is low. Quality of touch screen is excellent. My kid can watch youtube cartoons, play games perfectly."
"the Amazon Fire tablet is great for our daughter, has actually started reading more"
I bought it for a friend on christmas she love it. Very easy to use
"I gave this as a gift to another and got it back. I use it for fb and web, also, reading and Alexa. Can't be read in the sun."
Functional for what I need. Compact so travels well.
"Being a dedicated Apple user (with an iPhone, iPad mini, and MacBook Air), I didn't except to buy an android or Fire (which uses an OS very built on Android) tablet. But with this Fire tablet being sold for just $40 during the holidays, and some of the Google apps (I was most interested in Play Music) offering different functionality on Android/Fire tablets than on iOS devices, I thought I'd give it a try. After using it for 6 weeks, I can say the Fire is easily worth more than $40. It looks great, works well, and is light and easy to handle. The downsides are that the OS seems a little slower than iOS on my iPad, and the wireless router doesn't seem to be as powerful."
I use it for reading and I love it! I could take it anywhere.
This item was for the kids for Christmas. The Amazon FreeTime feature with multiple child user profiles is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time.
My God Daughter loves it it's just next time I should also get a screen protector for it because a few weeks later it has a small crack in it
Much better than I expected for such a great price.
My wife has enjoyed this tablet a lot. She plays a lot of card games and looks up recipe.
It's a really great tablet for Ebook exploring great
Great price for a tablet.Bought this for my father
"This one was for my baby, and she is happy as a kid with a new toy. I have my own tab so not familiar with fire yet. But was a good deal."
This is the 2nd one we have purchased for our kids. They love them.
Nice tablet for the price. My son liked it. Was easy to use
My niece love her tablet can beat the price only 39.99
Purchased this for a family member and they love it.
bought this one for my son in law. He was using his phone for internet. Now he is able to get on the internet a lot easier.
I purchased this item for my nephew and he loves it. It's small and works great. So far we have had no issues and the memory space is great.
This tablet is great for a toddler. Easy to use ! Easy to turn on & off.
Loved the gift my daughter can't put it down kid friendly
Bought this device for my dad. It is fairly simple for games and internet use.
This is the perfect gift for Grandkids especially to get them interested in reading.
Its bigger than a phone but smaller than an Ipad. I like it alot though and it does what I want it too.
We purchased this for our 10 yr old son with Aspergers. He was immediately able to understand and navigate the Amazon Fire. Thank you.
Very compact and functional. I especially like the screen color choices in the Kindle Reader.
The kindle fire is a nice little tablet its great for reading and watching netflix
"I got 4 for our boys 15 , 13, 10 & 5 Love that I can create profiles for them an manage their content"
"Grandson loves his tablet can't put it down play's games,watches his videos."
Everything was great. The actual item is holding up to our little ones expectations as well as mine ! This is definitely something that we would encourage everyone else to purchase as well. It's pretty fast and simple!
I love this. wish I brought a bigger screen one....
"For what this is, it's great. My 13 year old loves it. You'll definitely need to get an sd card for additional storage; but for the price, it's so worth it! Would be much happier with her breaking this than an expensive tablet!"
My children like to read and they wanted something they could have books on. This tablet allows for games as well without having the need to spend hundreds. It does the job for highschool.
I was looking for a cheap tablet and i just love it is like having a a $200 tablet it works the same.
"I purchased the item for $33 and was shocked when I began using it that the battery lasted 10 hours with moderate use, came with 6 months of free newspaper subscription and was preloaded with a lot of features. Its not the fastest in the world and I would prefer more storage, but for the price and considering how well it works I'm giving it 4 stars."
"first fire is great, purchased a second as a gift and its perfect."
It is easy to use and got of fun and popular apps. It is also quite good to use on the go and good camera.
"This is my 4th Kindle Fire. When we go on road trips each of the kids in the back of van are occupied watching movies, playing games or reading books on the Kindle."
It was for my 3 year old she loves it!! She was able to work it very easily!!
for the money nice tablet perfect fo my seven year old granddaughter
This is a great little tablet and I love the fact you can add more storage to it. So awesome and the battery life is fantastic. I recommend this to anyone. More affordable than an iPad and sturdier too.
Good tablet for kids and easy to use. Great for everyone
"I am enjoying this refrigerator, so far we have no problems with it."
"I love this tablet! Perfect size, great graphics and speed. Purchased this on sale during the holidays - great value!"
great tablet for not a lot of money. would recommend.
It's good for lil kids n small stuff . Doesn't look very fast
"The tablet is good for a 12 year old, i got it for my niece for Christmas and it will do what she wants,which is to play games and read books. Amazon is a little annoying because she had a hard time downloading some of the movies, because it wasn't ""compatible"", which is dumb since its their tablet and their site she was getting them from."
"This is a great little tablet. It is wonderful for reading, Going online and using apps. The only reason I gave it four stars was because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet. Other then that you're definitely getting the most bang for your buck. The price just cannot be beat."
"Gave it as a gift, and they loved it. It's perfect for anyone"
This tablet has all I need to enjoy using it. I bought it for the low price otherwise I may have waited to buy.
This tablet is able to do everything other tablets do. It has expandable memory and you are able to download apps from the play market.
"Bought this for my daughter, she loves it. Inexpensive, works great and she has a lot of fun with it"
extremely inexpensive! Was shocked at the price. I thought there must be a catch like I have to buy a membership for it to work. I was wrong. Downloaded 40 apps the 1st day and started using it right away. Its perfect for my 5 year old son to play with. Durable and won't scratch.
"I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well. If you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities (ideal for Amazon Prime members), this is perfect."
this tablet is the perfect size and very light weight. It is easy to set up and does everything I need it to do. Having a camera is useful too.
I bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it. His purchase was mainly based on his friends having this model and being very pleased with it. He is very pleased with it.
I basically use it to read news articles and stories online. It works well for what I use it for.
"I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating."
This is a very nice small and an inexpensive tablet.
got this for my mom and she loves it. easy to work
If you want a low budget tablet. This is the one. Don't be scared.
I bought three of these tablets for my grandkids for Christmas. My wife had 0ne and she rally loved it.
Didn't know that Amazon had control over everything. Should have bought any other tablet.
The ads aren't as annoying as you think they would be. Pretty lightweight and good battery life. Good for casual use.
Excellent product. Easy to use. Mostly used for reading and utilizing aps
"Nice, & easy to obtain. My nephew loves it, he has yet to break it"
Its the best and affordable tab for every one and super cool
purchased as a gift for my mom and she loves it. great starter tablet.
gets the jib done. makes for a good tablet for the kids to play on
It was good. I like it. Easy and simple to use. Better than apple ipad
I honestly didn't care for it. The newest versions of this tablet are by far much better. You have a bit more freedom with it than you do the older version.
A very nice and very helpful tablet. I always bring it with me And it helps a lot with my art career
I would recommend it..very durable and long lasting!
Nice tablet... the only downsize I see is you don't have the play store... so apps are limited
Good quality tablet that handles all your needs from young to old
Young readers don't have to keep up with a book. The tablet is good for young readers
Very nice improvements from earlier models. Resolutions better and greatly reduced sun glare. Certainly worth the investment.
I wasn't sure how the tablet would work out but getting this tablet was a great idea. And the price was awesome!!
I am pleased with my purchase. I use it daily. Ive downloaded several books. It has good picture quality and excellent sound.
They loved it and are always talking about their gift .
This is my second fire reader. I like how compact it is and also that can add sim card which I have. Only negative is I wish the battery life was a little better.
This tablet has everything you need to get you by. The quality is great and for the prize I can't complain.
"instead of spending a lot of money on a iPad for my kid, i bought this great alternative option. price is great! works great too!"
Replacement for earlier version of kindle fire. Extremely affordable.
"THIS TABLET SERVE THE PURPOSE ITS PURCHASE FOR, MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND HELPS HER GREATLY WITH HER PLAY TIME"
"This kindle is great, perfect size. Easy to navigate. I even purchased two more for family"
"Not only can you read books, you can do everything on it such as play games, order from Amazon login to Facebook and so much more!"
"This tablet works as intended. For $30 you couldn't go wrong with this purchase, Its fast and allows for additional storage via micro sd card. Great for the kids."
I bought this product as a gift for my son. He really likes it a lot.
Works for what hubby wanted it for. Will recommend.
"Bought this primarily to use as an e-reader. Got it on Cyber Monday so it was a pretty good deal. I live in the Google ecosystem so I loaded it with the google apps after buying it. I pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. If I want to use the internet I either use wi-fi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. It is a decent size for reading, although I think I would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. I have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage."
This product is real bad from amazon. Although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. Its way slow to respond to anything or everything. My 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this....wont recommend to anyone.
I really enjoy my tablet. It does everything that I was looking for in a tablet. Easy to use and small.
"Great device to use when you want to work on small things that doesn;t require a computer. It's portable and is capable of streaming with out problem. Battery life seems to go quickly, but real quick to recharge"
Is a great first tablet for a beginner or children
This tablet is perfect and works flawless. I wish i got another one
I purchased these for my grand kids for Christmas to watch kid shows on and these were a great price for what I wanted.
"The one purchased at Best Buy had black and gray lines appearing across the screen when powering up. It got worse, to occurring while using it. Amazon was contacted via Chat and determined something was wrong, and exchanged it. The replacement from Amazon is working, so for this I will mark, ""Yes"" to recommend it."
"Everything you need in a tablet !! Fast shipping, thank you."
Got this for my son. Love it! I get email notifications for every download so it's super easy to make sure he doesn't downloads ad anything inappropriate. Great little tablet
"Within the low price range, this tablet is excellent for watching TV, movies or reading a book. PROS: very sharp display, fast screen response, fair speaker, low price.CONS: need adding memory in form of micro-sd cards and becoming an Amazon Prime member to make this tablet worthwhile."
"Between my wife and I we have three apple I-pads. I purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter. It is an entertainment device. You can serf, email, watch movies on line and it makes an awesome remote for my Fire TV. It really pays off if you are an Amazon prime member. It has a version of the Amazon echo- but not quite as the echo or echo dot. I love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage. Perhaps they can teach this process to apple. After using this I have to admit that I have purchased my last IPad."
Good product at low price... and very good image resolution
Great inexpensive option for kids for continually break electronics.
It is a great simple tablet. Easy to use anyone can use it it.
"Was not planning on buying this, but the price pulled me in. Glad I picked it up."
Love this tablet. I got it for my niece to watch her videos on and educational videos. She doesn't put it down. The battery life is awesome.
"Difficult to get set up and logged in. This product was a gift to an elderly person and she had difficulty logging in. Had to go to Best Buy for assistance. Kept repeating log in was already being used. I have purchased 4 kindle fire tabletsas gifts and everyone seems to be enjoying them. Two were for kids, they enjoy downloading games."
"This is my second kindle purchase for a child under 5 years old. It's the most functionally and practical tablet. My first kindle is still working fine and my daughter has had it for 4 years now and it has grown with her. My kids love them, and I also received one for myself as a gift so we now have 3 in our household and none of them have been damaged at all. Despite how clumsy my children can be. I highly recommend the kindle!!"
excellent.they really enjoyed them. highly recommended.
No issues since Christmas. Works great. East to use for a 7 year old.
"love this tablet, I would so recommend this for others"
"Great price. Purchased for kiddos and seems hard to figure out, no instructions but company emailed me offering help to learn about new gadget from geek squad. Definitely great free apps program with tons of options!"
"Good tablet, very good quality. The screen looks great. It is quick and easy to use. The only bad thing is the applications, it does not have YouTube is another similar application but it is very bad. But for the price it seems advisable and affordable."
Was able to turn it on and log into the internet seamlessly. Very impressed with the speed and apps available. Great for the price! Buying another today!
"Great for reading books, news, email, TV, music...and games. A wonderful device that is light enough to carry anywhere. Especially good for travel. Easy to carry and get through airport security. Can use on the plane. An easy and inexpensive gateway to computer literacy for older folks."
Bought this for my daughter to read books on. Very pleased with the tablet so far.
Good Black Friday deal...Wife enjoys it for reading
Takes a bit to get used to OS but once you do it is a pretty decent tab for 40 bucks.
Works great for educational games and videos for my 4 & 7yr old
"""An inexpensive 'Tablet""' was the request on the Angel Tree at my son's middle school and we didn't even have to think twice about it. Unfortunately we get no feedback on the performance of these gifts but we hope and pray that it brings some happiness to the recipient. God Bless Us everyone!"
T-r-a-s-h.............................................. ....
"Bough the tablet for my 11 year old nephew, loves it! Great for online games and videos."
"I have two boys, 5 and 7, they empty the tablet's battery everyday playing, still working perfect.And parental control is very good."
The Kindle Fire is an excellent tablet for the price. Each member of my family has one and they meet all our needs and hold up very well.
"Great price over the holidays, recipient thrilled with the gift."
Our kids use these and they are a great tablet for the price. Handy for reading ebooks. They don't have quite the wifi range as a laptop but otherwise work fine.
Good startup tablet for reading articles online & shop
The best tablet for the money. I use it all the time.
Excellent tablet for everyday browsing and use. And a true bargain at the Black Friday price.
"This is my husbands tablet. It is just for general use, but he thinks it's great."
I brought this item for my parent and it fits all of her needs.
"pretty much you get what you pay for... not bad, but not great, but an inexpensive fix for the cause"
It is a nice little tablet for on the go or for kids. Wouldn't recommend using it for work
It's a great tablet for everyone I would recommend.
"We bought the tablet for work, but the only app we needed (free) never would download. After many tries and several hours, we gave up and took it back to the store."
I was buying tablets for two grandkids ages 5 and 10. These did the trick and I didn't have to spend a fortune. I also bought the protective cases to protect them...Great purchase!
This replaced a gift from the past year that didn't come with an expansion slot. He was very happy to get this.
"Purchased for my son right before a family trip, This thing is great and packs all the features I could have asked for."
Kindle fire 7 is a great affordable tablet has everthing i need.
I loved the tablet...does what it suppose to do...
I purchased a Samsung S7 and S7 Edge and they are even better than the previous phones I have owned.
"Gave it to my mom, who hasn't turned on a computer in 20 years. Showed her a couple of things, now she is a pro."
"At Times, I Just Want To Look Things Up-Watch Things-News etc etc-It's Perfect-On the Go."
Great tablet works good surfing the Web. And for my small child to listen to story books. He can see the screen very well. Since he has visual difficulty
She loves it and it's easy for her to use. Perfect for the younger child growing into adulthood.
Got it on sale for $40 for techo-illiterate dad and he likes it so far. Better screen quality than I expected.
"Hard to beat for the price. Great for browsing, movies, web."
I would like to say that they are really tuff the hold up to my kids lol
"Bought this to replace 2015 Black Friday Fire after and the battery died. While there is a lot of value built into the tablet, the battery in the first one started acting up after 6 months and progressed into not able to hold a charge. As my family had grown to like it, we bought another one with strong reservation. I hope this one lasts longer and I'd recommend it if does."
Easy to use and lots of features. Would recommend this item.
My sister in law needed a new tablet so the amazon was a good choice. I also got one for my mom and dad.
good product for the price and is large enough for viewing but small enough for travel
It is very easy and lightweight to carry around and use
I liked the ease of use and how quickly we could get it set up and is great for kids to use as well
For the price is good. But you have a lot of offers from Amazon on your main screen without even asking for it. Does not accept googlecast. The case for the tablet is too expensive. Well for basics it works fine
Bought it for my mom so we can stay in touch and she could play crossword games or Bingo at her Nursing home. She needs alot of assistance
Works good for the cost. Bought this for my dad and he loves it.
Works good just miss google play store. Nose resolution and speed
"Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for the price I paid. i find it much different than Samsung tabs or Apple iPad. so if you're used to these, amazon might not be a good pick for you. My grandson is disappointed we can't get YouTubekids on it. I've caught myself saying I should have paid a little more and gotten a Samsung. All in all, decent Tablet for a kid."
Is very good tablet for the price is worth it I will buy one again
Seems like a great tablet for my youngest daughter. The parental controls are nice and the battery life seems decent too.
I bought the device for my grand babies and they absolutely love it. My son says they pretty much haven't put it down since Christmas and I may need to buy another one so they don't have to share.
Great gift I bought for someone as Christmas gift and she loves it!
"Best Buy not only gave me great customer service, they were very patient with an ""older"" techie. At 67 I really appreciate being guided by a knowledgeable younger person. I would refer anyone looking for electronic devices to Best Buy."
"I bought this originally for a younger child to download apps for learning for school and for a few games. It works well, no issues with that, but it is a little harder for him to navigate. From my standpoint, it is smooth and operates the way I expect it."
Don't underestimate the power and versatility of this Fire. I'd definitely recommend it!
Great device for someone who is not very technologically advanced. Easy to use and understand.
Works great with everything thing I use. Battery lasts long but gets hot with games.
I purchased one for each of my kids (4) and they love them and now I don't have to fight for my phone because they are on it playing app games lol!!!
This device meet my expectations. Fully recommended.
Had been.looking at this item on Amazon and hoped it would go in sale. It did and I was able to purchase at Best Buy.
I bought this as a gift and my nephew really enjoys it.
"This was my third Fire 7"" 2015 to purchase. One for me and two for gifts. The apps in the Amazon appstore are not a numerous as in other stores, but I've got email apps, games, office productivity, everything I ""need"". For a simple to use tablet it gets the job done very well. As an e-book reader it's great, but not outstanding. The screen is not as nice as higher end models, but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat! The speaker is mono and not as loud as nicer Fire units, but again this is a sub $50 unit.I use mine daily for email, web, some simple games, I've even sideloaded a few apps that work great (Your mileage may vary).Expect to like the unit for what it can do and you'll be happy. If you think this one is as good as a $150 tablet, well look elsewhere.All the sub $50 tablets I've seen out there can't hold a candle to this one's build quality and features."
It performed the way it said it would and more!Awesome buy!
I love the price and also the navigation. It was easy for set up very Convenient and light to carry. The screen is also very visible not blurring like other brands.
My girls love the tablet. Great value for the money.
This was a present for my father and he hasn't complained one bit about it.
It is a very good product and the attention of employees was very good
Perfect item for my grand-kids and the price was especially just what I needed.
"I love my kindle fire. They are a great compact device that can do so much. I can read books for free, play a game and look up answers to my kids questions so quickly!"
Purchased this and I love it! It's easy to setup and easy to use.
This is actually my second one in 2 years due to my boyfriend taking ownership of the first one.
Perfect gift for my mom who was homebound after surgery. Made the time go by so much faster!
Not a bad tablet but well worth the $$$. The battery is horrible tho after about a year or so worth of use. It drops off quite a bit and the USB charging port has issues.
"Good tablet to browse the Web, good for a beginner"
"I originally bought the tablet because I enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles. Not having time to do them at home, I found apps that I could use on the cell phone while on the train. But, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. I've found that I can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the Kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time I can spend on them, that's good enough for me.But, the Kindle offers so much more. There are other great games and puzzle apps from the APP Store plus there's a six-month ""free"" trial subscription to the WASHINGTON POST. You can go online via WiFi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the Internet, just like on a regular computer.It's great fun!"
"Very nice tablet for the price.. only problem, it sort of ""ties"" you up to be an amazon subscriber for a fee, so beware of this :)"
This tablet has been easy to use and setup for my daughter.
I needed a good tablet for my niece and my nephew.
Good for everyday use. Grandsons wish there could be more free access
My 3 yr old niece loves her kindle. I couldn't imagine going on a road trip without it.
Our kids ranging from 4-12 like this product. It's very versatile for all ages
"Can't beat the price on this tablet. It greatly serves its purpose, I bought it for my kids to read. They love it!"
Great tablet. Easy to use. Purchased as a gift for a family member.
Tablet is great for our 8 year old grandchildren to use.
fire is slow when surfing web. i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store
This tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the WiFi does not work well. The WiFi turns off and I have to manually reset it over and over. The camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my needs. Does not make sense why there is not a version without cameras with a bigger screen size.
Great Tablet for the price. Its very good for beginner.
was a great buy for my mom. would recommend to anyone who read a lot of paper backs.
I have bought a lot of tablets for my kids and all have broken. This tablet has lasted the longest and is the most kid friendly.
Absolutely love my Kindle fire. Would buy for friends and family. It is the perfect combination of a tablet and e-reader.
"The fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. Its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. It makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. For the price, not bad."
I can not believe how nice this Fire is for the $33 I paid for it. I would Not spend a lot of money on a expensive tablet when this one will do most everything the big dollar ones will do!
"This has been user friendly for my dad, who is 78. Always provides entertainment and meets his computer needs."
I bought 4 of these and gave them to my nice and nephews for their Christmas gift. They are a awesome tablet for the price.
This is a great tablet. I bought several for gifts. Best Buy had the best price. I only gave four stars because of all the ads preloaded to these tablets is a pain.
This tablet is easy to use and a convenient size for travel.
Bought this for my niece and it works great. Access to all the apps she likes and easy to use.
"I decided I wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. I researched the Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. The device is slick and easy to use, and the Alexa integration is really cool. But ""It's a $50 tablet"". At times, the performance is awful slow. I suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or FB. My complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. I finally got on Amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. The reps at Amazon tried their best - and FWIW, I knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before I contacted them, but I thought I would give it a try. So get this if you want, just be patient. Remember, ""It's a $50 tablet"". If you want better performance, spend more $$."
I brought this tablet for my son for Christmas and he loves it. I would definitely recommend this tablet as a starter tablet for younger kids.
It was really easy to setup for my kids and is a great size for them
"This is an easy to use tablet. It was easy to set up and easy for my 6 year old to use. I purchased one of the off brand tablets for my other kid and have had a lot of problems with the charging port. Not with this tablet, worth a little extra money."
Bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!
I got this on a flash sale in at the moment and it was a great purchase. I didn't plan on getting one that day but I did and for $50 which I got it before it was totally worth it. I got a really nice blue colored Amazon tablet and I am happy with that. I can read books on it and use it when someone else is using one of the more expensive tablet I just want to relax and read a book. It is also great for surfing Internet you can play games on it as well. It is great for kids because it is sturdy even without a case it has still held up nicely .
Tablet is modest for it's price. Good for beginners.
I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it
Vivid color and picture quality. The quad processor seems faster than a quad. The Kindle is user friendly.
Great tablet Very good put together and easy to use Greatest for gaming
It is affordable and a great product. Its a great ereader as well as a great tablet. Just the right size to play games and watch movies on.
Great little tablet I gave as a gift to my mom. She is not tech savvy at all and she seems to have no real issues using it.
These made great christmas gifts for my family that isn't too tech savvy but they love them and use it frequently!
Gave this as a Christmas gift to my uncle because he has been given other tablets that did perform as they advertised. I have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the Fire and his answer has always been yes. I also purchased one for myself as well and it has continued to perform as well as it did on the first day I started it up. It is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology. I would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a second thought.
"Great to use for a daily use, easy to use and light and great to watch movies."
So easy to set up and use right away. Dual camera is great.
"Got tablet for daughter, great tablet, size and easy to use."
"Bought this for my son who is 3. He loves it. Compared to an iPad isn't not great, but for $50, it's pretty great."
Its cool for kids and safe with the case if your kid dropped
the tablet is okay its not like apple I pad don't cheat your self .
We bought 2 of these for our 2 oldest grandkids. They loved them and were excited to receive them and to use them on a trip to Florida.
"Thank you, the Fire works great!! My daughter is on it all the time, and I can regulate what she looks at."
This was a great Christmas gift. the price was great and the amazon fire is small enough to bring with to travel .
this was a great gift for the kids. We are going on a vacation and The amazon fires are a great tool for them to download games and search the web while we are traveling..thanks
Basic tablet that we got for our toddler. Offers enough apps to keep her entertained and a low price point. If she breaks this I will not be too upset compared to other tablets.
I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the charging port. There is a small metal prong that lines up with the cable that can get bent if you do not plug it in VERY CAREFULLY. Have had to send one back because it would no longer charge. Otherwise great tablet.
"This was actually my second purchase of this tablet. Overall the finish is good; everything works pretty fine. It has all of the amazon services that you need like kindle, amazon music.... The touch screen still has some delay, however. Once in a while they put it on sale for $30. If your not in a hurry, like if you already own a tablet and are not really in need of a second one, then you can wait because I believe at the price of 30, this tablet is unbeatable."
Easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.
Great for the kids to have and play games on. They want put it down.
Cant beat the price for a tablet. This is the best bang 4 buck.
Great little tablet for my young family member and the price is right.
"Great gift for a kid to read, surf and play music!"
My Nephew and mom loved their tablets! He is 6 and takes it everywhere. Easy to set up and use
I think this is the best table for reading books and just browsing the net.
Best starter device in place of an iPad or computer.
A perfect gift for entry level person. Very light weight and handy to use
The one thing I miss is the google store. some games i love to play aren't available.
I bought this to use with a particular app but wasn't able to install them so I returned the tablets.
"got five of these at black friday, great price and deal, worth the money"
Short on memory but easily expands with memory stick. Works great for everyday tasks.
Purchased this for my mother in law who loves to read but can't always get to the library. It was easy for her to download books with simple instructions. Now she is hooked on some games. Best gift ever!
bought it for my niece and she loved it she was super happy
"My daughter got this for Christmas. Right out of the box it came on, but the screen was all white. Good price, but could never get it to work."
I couldn't pass this one up for the money. Buy them for your kids so they can stay occupied for hours and get fat.
"Excellent Amazon product perfect for my 4 year old, I put it into kids mode and she loved it!"
For the price it's perfect. Does all the basics well and if you break it you won't be heartbroken. Well worth it.
"Nice size. Functions as expected. Use it for reading books, email and a bit of web surfing. Like that you can turn down the screen brightness for night reading. Took off one star because it is tied to the Amazon store for apps and you can't easily edit Google docs & spreadsheets as you can on an Android tablet."
I bought this tablet for my kids on Xmas and they really like it ..
Bought it for my daughter. She loves it! makes me happy:)
I bought this kindle fire because it was on sale. After I took it home i realized I would have bought it at full price. This is a great ereader that you can also use to browse the web. My son loves using this to read his Ebooks and play his games.
"Amazon Fire Tablet is cool. Very useful, especially for my son playing games, downloading free games and ebooks."
"it was a good purchase i dont regret to buy it; it is great for readers, and those who play app games. It is a little slow sometimes."
The Kindle Fire will not disappoint - durable and easy to use. We have 4 kids using them all tied to the same amazon account. So convenient!
Does everything my kindle did for half the price!!
"everything you need, good price, easy to use and kid friendly"
I was able to run this fire tablet with Kodi and now this tablet kicks @$$
"We have a couple of these now for our kids. Create a kid account and allow access to a few apps, add a memory card for more storage for movie video files that you have and it's enough to entertain the kids on car trips or keep them from going nuts in restaurants occasionally."
"Perfect color, size, and price for our family needs."
"Perfect color, size and price for our family needs."
This item was purchased as a gift. I heard nothing bad about this tablet so i can say it is a good tablet for kids.
I am very happy about this Amazon tablet purchase at Best Buy and it is working great.
"great price and a better gift,i was looking nice gift."
Awesome kindle fire. Great features and durability. Free shipping sealed the deal.
"Bought this Tablet around Christmas Holiday, easy set-up, download apps, & can download e-books, great for under $100. Highly recommend to pick this up!"
"I bought this tablet for my children, I love it for its parental control settings as well as how fast it is. The volume is louder than many other tablets I have handled, which makes it great for watching videos or game play. I would definitely recommend this product and would purchase it again"
My grandson loved it! Shipping was lightning fast!Thank you!
So far it has been easy to use which is what i was looking for. The graphics are good and I love all of the free apps. I can get. The cost was great too!
great purchase. it does everything as expected. very easy to setup.
"From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't."
"Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average."
The amazon fire '7 tablet was $33 on black Friday. How could I not buy a name brand tablet for that little
Great value and responds quickly to the touch. I bought two tablets for my college son's for Christmas. This tablet is great to connect to wifi and use to watch hulu and netflix in bed. Super!!!
Decent tablet for the price. Economic tablet for easy browsing.
Great for kids and adults !easy to use and carry around
There shouldnt be an 8 gig tablet. Not enough internal memory. Kindle Fire tablets work on a modified Android operating system. But other than that a good tablet for the price.
"The Fire Stick is inexpensive, easy to set up and really responsive. Ended up buying a few of these for the entire family."
Brought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.
"This tablet is a good beginner model. If you are new to the world of tablets, you may want something faster."
I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts for my son and 2 granddaughters. I purchased 2 different colors for the girls so they wouldn't fight and one for my son to replace a broken tablet. They all love them.
love the color. easily to navigate and add apps. need a memory card though.
"great for kids ,my son loves it and good price for product"
doesn't allow for my apps but with memory card it will.
a birthday gift for my son and he likes it. always attached to his hand and always on it.
"This is extremely easy to use, packed with abilities, and has internet capabilities. I can't believe all of this for such a low price. This is the only tablet anyone needs."
Works great as a movie player. All I use it for is watching movies on an airplane or at sea.
"I purchased three of these tablets as Christmas gifts for my kids. It was a great deal since Best Buy had them on sale for $33/ea. They were very excited to get their own tablet. The 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. The Amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account."
"Bought this for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. He uses it for kid games (not true gaming). Parental restrictions/blocks work well. He seems to love it. I think this is a perfect ""first"" tablet or nice tablet for an adult not needing all the bells and whistles of a more expensive one. It is smaller and easily carried so it is perfect for web surfing, reading books, and simple games. At this price point, I think it was a great purchase."
"I purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so I bought his his own. Best Buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. This is an amazing purchase for the price."
This is a great and convenient tablet at an unbeatable price.buy one before all gone
"Bought as a Christmas gift. I got it on Black Friday, so the price was very good. My daughter can use this in her classes and it's a great size. I even bought another one after Christmas because we liked it so much!"
Product serves as reader and simple tablet. Used as personal device when traveling. Good product for the money.
"Bought for my Mom, easy to use, simple and she can load all of her books onto her tablet."
I purchased this tablet for my daughter. I can set parental controls and it has lasted her for a while.
"If you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. We have 4 total and Amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. They even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past."
I purchased this as a gift and it went over very well. She loved it.
Bought this for my 89 year old mother. She loves it!
"Great for grandkids, my six year old grandson loves it."
"I bought this tablet on Black Friday and it was on sale. It's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. What bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. I only really use it to watch Netflix- so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device."
My son loves his Kindle for games and he loves it for reading.
Got this for my boy and he loves it plus he had dropped it a few times picks it up and keeps on playing
Chose this tablet due to the parental control features as a gift for my granddaughter.
This made my brother life easier in school An work
Bought this for my mother to replace older RCA tablet and this one is so much better! She loves it!
This tablet was purchased as a Christmas gift and our nephew absolutely loves it.
bought for grandkids they love them. wise choice I made
"The screen is beautiful. It does everything the iPad can do if not more. You are definitely not settling for less but, keeping more money in your pocket if you choose this device over and iPad."
you just cant beat the value here. great having one of these
Great tablet and for a great price. Good for gifts.
