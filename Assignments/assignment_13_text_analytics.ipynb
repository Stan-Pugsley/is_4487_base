Restaurants compete with not only all of the other restaurants in local area, but also with the option for customers to stay home and cook their own food.  Chefs and restaurant owners must monitor customer feedback to see if they should make changes to their pricing, menu options, restaurant amenities and seating/serving process.\n",
