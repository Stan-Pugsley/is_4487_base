        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Choose an industry you're interested in (such as tech, airlines, or retail)\n",
        "- Use the `yfinance` Python package as an API to collect historical stock price data\n",
        "- Clean and prepare the data for analysis\n",
        "- Explore trends, volatility, and relationships between companies\n",
        "- Summarize your findings and recommendation in a business memo\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow businesses to pull live, real-world data from external sources directly into their analytics tools. Financial analysts, investment firms, and business leaders use APIs like `yfinance` to monitor company performance, assess market trends, and build models based on dynamic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment helps you gain hands-on experience with one of the most common API workflows in business analytics: fetching, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting financial data to support better decision-making.\n",
