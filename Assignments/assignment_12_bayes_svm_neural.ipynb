        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "- Understand how to use classification models (Naïve Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks) to predict hotel cancellations.\n",
        "- Compare models in terms of accuracy, complexity, and business relevance.\n",

        "\n",
        "You work as a data analyst for a hospitality group that manages both **Resort** and **City Hotels**. One major challenge in operations is the unpredictability of **booking cancellations**, which affects staffing, inventory, and revenue planning.\n",

        "You’ve been asked to use historical booking data to predict whether a future booking will be canceled. Your insights will help management plan more effectively.\n",

        "\n",
        "Your task is to:\n",
        "1. Build and evaluate three models: Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Neural Network.\n",
        "2. Compare performance.\n",
        "3. Recommend which model is best suited for the business needs.\n",
