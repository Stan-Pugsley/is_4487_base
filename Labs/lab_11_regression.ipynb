        "# Lab 11: Linear Regression for HR\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, weâ€™ll use the merged HR dataset to build a **linear regression model** to predict the number of years that an employee will work for the company (job tenure).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "A large company employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this employee turnover is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -\n",
        "\n",
        "- The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners\n",
        "- A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent\n",
        "- More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to increase the number of years that employees stay with the company. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since you are one of the star analysts at the firm, this project has been given to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goal of the case study\n",
        "You are required to model the number of years employees work for the company using a llinear regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Analytics Objectives:\n",
        "1. Load and explore the dataset\n",
        "2. Clean and prepare features\n",
        "3. Encode categorical variables\n",
        "4. Split the data into training and test sets\n",
